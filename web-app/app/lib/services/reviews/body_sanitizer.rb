    # Single implementation of review-body cleaning. Called from Review's
    # before_validation and directly by the increment-2 migrator, which bulk-inserts
    # and so bypasses callbacks.
    #
    # Spoilers are resolved by the HTML parser, never by string substitution. `spoiler`
    # is allowlisted for the sanitize pass so a genuine <spoiler> becomes a real node,
    # then those nodes are renamed. Text that merely looks like a spoiler tag inside an
    # attribute value is escaped by the parser and never becomes a node.
    #
    # Do NOT go back to tokenizing the string and substituting after sanitizing. Any
    # marker robust enough to survive sanitizing also survives inside an attribute
    # value, so the substitution splices raw markup into a quoted string:
    # `<a href="<spoiler>evil</spoiler>">click</a>` became
    # `<a href="<span class="review-spoiler">evil</span>">click</a>`, which a browser
    # re-parses into a bogus href and visible link text of `evil">click`.
    #
    # Renaming after sanitizing is also what stops a user supplying their own class:
    # `span` is not in ALLOWED_TAGS, so a user-written <span class="review-spoiler"> is
    # stripped, and a class on their own <spoiler> is replaced with ours -- every other
    # attribute (title, href, ...) is stripped from the node too, or a native browser
    # tooltip would leak the spoiler text right through the blur.
    #
    # Blank is decided on rendered TEXT, not on the markup string -- "<br>", "<p></p>",
    # an empty <a href>, and a lone &nbsp; all sanitize to non-empty markup that
    # visually renders as nothing. `fragment.text` is checked (with &nbsp; folded to a
    # plain space first, since String#strip does not treat U+00A0 as whitespace) after
    # convert_spoilers, which returns the parsed fragment rather than re-serializing it,
    # so there is only one parse. This subsumes the plain <img>-only case, since `img`
    # is not in the allowlist and so contributes no text either.
    #
    # Does not truncate. Length is a Review validation, so an over-long paste raises a
    # user-visible error instead of losing text.

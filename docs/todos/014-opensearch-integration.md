- **Developer**: Claude (AI Assistant)

## Overview
Implement OpenSearch integration for music models (Artist, Album, Song) to provide fast, relevant search functionality. Focus on a clean, modular architecture where each query type has its own class to avoid the massive search class problem from The Greatest Books.

## Context
- The Greatest Books has a huge search class that's difficult to maintain
- OpenSearch provides better full-text search capabilities than PostgreSQL
- We need to start with music models as they're well-developed
- Search should be by relevance, with basic fields only initially
- We'll handle complex features like genres and filtering later

## Requirements
- [x] Set up OpenSearch infrastructure with single URL
- [ ] Create base indexing and search classes for shared functionality
- [ ] Implement music-specific index classes (Artist, Album, Song)
- [ ] Create separate general search query classes for each music type (artist, album, song)
- [ ] Focus on core searchable fields (name/title as most important)
- [ ] Use keyword fields for structured data (years, enums, etc.)
- [ ] Implement general search functionality only (no autocomplete initially)
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage following namespacing requirements
- [ ] Background indexing jobs for keeping search data in sync

## Technical Approach

### Environment Variables
```
OPENSEARCH_URL=https://localhost:9200
```

### Directory Structure
```

```

### Index Field Mapping Strategy

**Music::Artist Index**:
- `name` (text with keyword) - Primary search field
- `kind` (keyword) - "person" or "band" 
- `country` (keyword) - ISO 2-letter country code
- `year_formed` (keyword) - For bands
- `year_disbanded` (keyword) - For bands
- `year_died` (keyword) - For people

**Music::Album Index**:
- `title` (text with keyword) - Primary search field
- `release_year` (keyword) - Year as keyword for filtering
- `primary_artist_name` (text with keyword) - Denormalized artist name
- `primary_artist_id` (keyword) - For joining back to PostgreSQL

**Music::Song Index**:
- `title` (text with keyword) - Primary search field
- `duration_secs` (keyword) - Duration for filtering
- `release_year` (keyword) - Year as keyword for filtering
- `isrc` (keyword) - International Standard Recording Code

### Base Class Architecture

```ruby
# Base indexing functionality
class Search::Base::Index
  def self.client
    @client ||= OpenSearch::Client.new(host: ENV.fetch("OPENSEARCH_URL"))
  end

  def self.delete_index
    # Implementation
  end

  def self.create_index
    # Implementation using Ruby hash instead of JSON
  end

  def self.bulk_index(items)
    # Bulk indexing implementation
  end
end

# Base search functionality
class Search::Base::Search
  def self.client
    @client ||= OpenSearch::Client.new(host: ENV.fetch("OPENSEARCH_URL"))
  end

  def self.search(query_definition)
    # Execute search and return results
  end
end
```

### Query Architecture

Each search query gets its own class:

```ruby
# General artist search
class Search::Music::ArtistGeneral < Search::Base::Search
  def self.call(text, options = {})
    # Build search query for text across artist fields
    # Focus on name as primary field
  end
end

# General album search
class Search::Music::AlbumGeneral < Search::Base::Search
  def self.call(text, options = {})
    # Build search query for text across album fields
    # Focus on title and artist name
  end
end

# General song search
class Search::Music::SongGeneral < Search::Base::Search
  def self.call(text, options = {})
    # Build search query for text across song fields
    # Focus on title
  end
end
```

### Index Definitions as Ruby Hashes

Instead of JSON files, define indexes as Ruby hashes:

```ruby
class Search::Music::ArtistIndex < Search::Base::Index
  def self.index_definition
    {
      settings: {
        analysis: {
          analyzer: {
            folding: {
              tokenizer: "standard",
              filter: ["lowercase", "asciifolding"]
            }
          }
        }
      },
      mappings: {
        properties: {
          name: {
            type: "text",
            analyzer: "folding",
            fields: {
              keyword: {
                type: "keyword",
                normalizer: "lowercase"
              }
            }
          },
          kind: {
            type: "keyword"
          },
          country: {
            type: "keyword"
          },
          year_formed: {
            type: "keyword"
          },
          year_disbanded: {
            type: "keyword"
          },
          year_died: {
            type: "keyword"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  end
end
```

## Dependencies
- `opensearch-ruby` gem (need to add to Gemfile)
- Sidekiq for background indexing jobs
- Music models (Music::Artist, Music::Album, Music::Song)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OpenSearch clients can connect to the OpenSearch URL
- [ ] Base indexing and search classes provide shared functionality
- [ ] Music index classes can create, delete, and bulk index their respective models
- [ ] General search query classes return relevant results for their respective music types
- [ ] Search results are ordered by relevance score
- [ ] Index definitions are Ruby hashes, not JSON files
- [ ] Background jobs keep indexes in sync with model changes
- [ ] All classes follow domain-driven design with proper namespacing
- [ ] 100% test coverage with realistic fixtures
- [ ] Performance is suitable for expected search volume

## Design Decisions
- **Single OpenSearch URL**: Simplified configuration with one URL for all operations
- **Ruby hash index definitions**: More maintainable than JSON files
- **Separate query classes**: Each search type gets its own class to avoid large search classes
- **Keyword fields for structured data**: Years, enums, and IDs as keywords for exact matching
- **Text with keyword mapping**: Primary search fields have both analyzed text and exact keyword versions
- **Base class inheritance**: Shared functionality in base classes, specific logic in domain classes
- **Start with music only**: Focus on one domain to establish patterns before expanding

## Future Enhancements
- Autocomplete search classes
- Advanced filtering (genres, complex criteria)
- Cross-media search
- Search result ranking based on user preferences
- Real-time indexing via model callbacks
- Search analytics and performance monitoring

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
- Implemented a clean, modular OpenSearch integration with separate classes for each concern
- Started with basic name/title search functionality to establish the foundation
- Used domain-driven design with proper namespacing under `Search::Music::`
- Simplified the initial implementation to focus on core search functionality

### Key Files Changed
**Base Classes:**
- `app/lib/search/base/index.rb` - Base indexing functionality with OpenSearch client
- `app/lib/search/base/search.rb` - Base search functionality with shared query methods
- `app/lib/search/shared/client.rb` - OpenSearch client management  
- `app/lib/search/shared/utils.rb` - Text cleanup and query building utilities

**Music Index Classes:**
- `app/lib/search/music/artist_index.rb` - Artist indexing with name field
- `app/lib/search/music/album_index.rb` - Album indexing with title and artist name
- `app/lib/search/music/song_index.rb` - Song indexing with title and artist names (through albums)

**Music Search Classes:**
- `app/lib/search/music/search/artist_general.rb` - General artist search by name
- `app/lib/search/music/search/album_general.rb` - General album search by title and artist name
- `app/lib/search/music/search/song_general.rb` - General song search by title and artist names

**Model Updates:**
- `app/models/music/artist.rb` - Added `as_indexed_json` method returning name only
- `app/models/music/album.rb` - Added `as_indexed_json` method with title and artist name
- `app/models/music/song.rb` - Added `as_indexed_json` method with title and artist names from albums

### Challenges Encountered
- Initially over-engineered with too many search fields and methods
- Needed to simplify the approach to focus on core name/title search functionality
- Song-to-artist relationship required going through albums, so included all artist names from all albums

### Deviations from Plan
- **Simplified field mapping**: Removed complex fields like years, countries, durations, and ISRCs
- **Focused on names only**: Artist index only has name field, album has title + artist name, song has title + artist names
- **Removed specific search methods**: Eliminated search_by_year, search_by_country, etc. methods
- **Parent relationship indexing**: Songs index artist names through album relationships, albums index primary artist name

### Code Examples
**Basic search pattern:**
```ruby
# Search artists by name
results = Search::Music::ArtistGeneral.call("Beatles")

# Search albums by title or artist name  
results = Search::Music::AlbumGeneral.call("Abbey Road")

# Search songs by title or artist name
results = Search::Music::SongGeneral.call("Come Together")
```

**Index management:**
```ruby
# Create and populate indexes
Search::Music::ArtistIndex.reindex_all
Search::Music::AlbumIndex.reindex_all  
Search::Music::SongIndex.reindex_all

# Index individual items
Search::Music::ArtistIndex.index_artist(artist)
Search::Music::AlbumIndex.index_album(album)
Search::Music::SongIndex.index_song(song)
```

### Testing Approach
- **Real OpenSearch Integration**: Tests use actual OpenSearch with test indexes (appended with Rails.env)
- **Removed Conditional Logic**: Eliminated opensearch_available? checks that were hiding errors
- **Parallel Test Support**: Added process ID to index names for parallel test execution
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 19 tests covering utility functions, index management, and search functionality
- **Fixtures-Based**: Uses Rails fixtures for test data with properly namespaced music artists
- **No Over-Mocking**: Tests verify actual functionality rather than mocking everything

### Performance Considerations
- Uses bulk indexing for efficient reindexing of large datasets
- Includes proper database relationships (`includes`) to avoid N+1 queries
- Uses OpenSearch boost values to prioritize exact matches over fuzzy matches

### Major Refactoring - Interface Standardization
After initial implementation, performed significant refactoring to eliminate code duplication:
- **Standardized Interface**: All index classes now have consistent methods: `index()`, `unindex()`, `find()`, `reindex_all()`
- **DRY Implementation**: Moved all common functionality to base classes
- **Simplified Subclasses**: Each index class now only needs to define `model_klass`, `model_includes`, and `index_definition`
- **50% Code Reduction**: Eliminated ~30 lines of duplicate code from each index class
- **Class Method Inheritance**: Successfully used Ruby class method inheritance for clean abstraction

Before refactoring:
```ruby
# Each index class had duplicate methods
def self.index_artist(artist); index_item(artist); end
def self.unindex_artist(artist); unindex_item(artist.id); end
def self.find_artist(id); find_by_id(id); end
def self.reindex_all; [20+ lines of duplicate logic]; end
```

After refactoring:
```ruby
# Clean, inherited interface
def self.model_klass; ::Music::Artist; end
# All interface methods inherited from base class
```

### Code Quality Improvements
- **StandardRB Compliance**: Fixed all linting issues including ineffective access modifiers
- **Private Method Handling**: Used `private_class_method` for proper class method privacy
- **Removed Dead Code**: Eliminated unused utility methods (`safe_enum_value`, `extract_year_from_date`, etc.)
- **Test Reliability**: Removed conditional `opensearch_available?` logic that was hiding errors

### Parallel Test Execution Fix
- **Problem**: Tests were failing in parallel due to shared index names
- **Solution**: Added process ID suffix to test index names (`music_artists_test_12345`)
- **Implementation**: Used `Process.pid` for unique worker identification
- **Result**: Tests now run reliably in parallel without conflicts

### Future Improvements
- Implement autocomplete search classes
- Add filtering by year, genre, country, etc.
- Implement cross-media search capabilities
- Add real-time indexing via model callbacks
- Background job system for managing reindexing queue

### Lessons Learned
- Start simple and build up complexity incrementally
- Focus on core functionality first before adding advanced features
- Clean separation of concerns makes the system much more maintainable
- Each search query type deserves its own class to avoid monolithic search modules

## Overview
Implement a simple UI that displays ranked albums using DaisyUI and Tailwind. This will be our first real UI implementation in the application.

## Context
- This is the first user-facing UI for displaying ranked data
- Sets the foundation for similar ranking UIs across all media types
- Uses the existing ranking system with RankingConfiguration and RankedItem models

## Requirements
- [ ] Create base controller hierarchy: RankedItemsController → Music::RankedItemsController → Music::Albums::RankedItemsController
- [ ] Support two URL patterns: `/albums` and `/rc/:id/albums`
- [ ] Load appropriate RankingConfiguration (global primary or specific ID)
- [ ] Validate that ranking configuration is for albums (404 if not)
- [ ] Display ranked albums with pagination using Pagy gem
- [ ] Prevent N+1 queries with proper joins/includes
- [ ] Show album name, artist, year, primary image, and categories
- [ ] Use DaisyUI components for styling
- [ ] Write controller tests for endpoint success (not content)

## Technical Approach
1. Create base controller classes without routes
2. Use Rails generator for Music::Albums::RankedItemsController
3. Configure routes for both URL patterns
4. Implement controller logic with ranking configuration validation
5. Create ERB template with DaisyUI styling
6. Add pagination with Pagy
7. Optimize queries to prevent N+1 issues

## Dependencies
- Pagy gem (already added)
- RankingConfiguration model
- RankedItem model
- Music::Album model with associations
- DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/albums` displays ranked albums using global primary configuration
- [ ] `/rc/:id/albums` displays ranked albums for specific configuration
- [ ] 404 error if ranking configuration is not for albums
- [ ] Albums sorted by rank
- [ ] Pagination works correctly
- [ ] No N+1 query issues
- [ ] UI shows: album name, artist, year, image, categories
- [ ] Controller tests pass for both endpoints

## Design Decisions
- Use inheritance hierarchy for future media type support
- ERB templates instead of View Components initially
- Focus on functionality over advanced styling
- No linking to detail pages yet

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
Successfully implemented a complete UI for displaying ranked albums using Rails controllers, DaisyUI components, and Pagy pagination.

### Key Files Created/Modified
- `app/controllers/ranked_items_controller.rb` - Base controller with common ranking logic
- `app/controllers/music/ranked_items_controller.rb` - Music-specific base controller
- `app/controllers/music/albums/ranked_items_controller.rb` - Albums-specific controller
- `app/views/music/albums/ranked_items/index.html.erb` - DaisyUI-styled view template
- `app/helpers/application_helper.rb` - Added Pagy::Frontend for pagination
- `config/routes.rb` - Added routes for /albums and /rc/:id/albums
- `config/initializers/pagy.rb` - Pagy configuration
- `test/controllers/music/albums/ranked_items_controller_test.rb` - Comprehensive tests

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Pagy Integration**: AVO had compatibility issues with Pagy::Backend during Rails generation. Fixed by updating Pagy to stable version and proper initialization.
2. **Polymorphic Associations**: Cannot eagerly load polymorphic associations directly. Resolved with custom SQL joins for optimal performance.
3. **Domain Detection in Tests**: Layout rendering failed because tests didn't set proper host. Fixed by using `host!` in test setup and proper music layout.
4. **Exception Handling**: Added global ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound handling to return proper 404 responses.

### Technical Decisions
- **Controller Hierarchy**: Created inheritance chain (RankedItemsController → Music::RankedItemsController → Music::Albums::RankedItemsController) for future extensibility
- **Layout Strategy**: Used domain-specific layouts (`music/application`) matching existing pattern
- **Query Optimization**: Custom SQL joins instead of includes to prevent N+1 queries while handling polymorphic associations
- **Pagination**: Pagy gem with 25 items per page and Bootstrap styling
- **Validation**: Type checking ensures only album ranking configurations are used

### UI Implementation
- **DaisyUI Components**: Used cards, badges, grids, and responsive design
- **Album Display**: Shows rank, title, artist(s), year, primary image, and categories
- **Responsive Grid**: 1-4 columns based on screen size
- **Empty State**: Friendly message when no albums found
- **Pagination**: Clean pagination controls at bottom

### Testing Approach
- **Controller Tests**: Focus on HTTP response codes, not content
- **Host Configuration**: Proper domain setup for multi-domain architecture
- **Error Scenarios**: 404 handling for missing/wrong configurations
- **All Tests Pass**: 1188 tests with 0 failures/errors

### Performance Considerations
- Custom SQL joins prevent N+1 queries
- Eager loading for associations where possible
- Pagination limits database load
- Optimized queries for rank ordering

### Code Quality
- Follows Rails conventions and project patterns
- Proper namespacing for multi-domain architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling
- No comments as per project standards

### Future Improvements
- View components for reusable UI elements
- Advanced filtering and sorting options
- Album detail pages with linking
- Caching for ranking results
- Real-time updates for ranking changes

### Lessons Learned
1. Multi-domain Rails apps require careful host configuration in tests
2. Polymorphic associations need special handling for eager loading
3. DaisyUI provides excellent components for rapid UI development
4. Proper inheritance hierarchies enable clean extensibility
5. Domain-specific layouts maintain consistent user experience

### Final Implementation Summary
- **Complete UI**: First working UI for The Greatest with album rankings display
- **Performance Optimized**: No N+1 queries, efficient pagination
- **Cache-Friendly**: URLs designed for edge caching with explicit page paths
- **Extensible Architecture**: Controller hierarchy ready for books/movies/games
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, testing, and validation
- **Clean Code**: Follows all project standards and conventions

### Documentation Created
Following project documentation standards, created documentation for all new classes:
- Controller hierarchy documentation
- Helper method documentation  
- View template patterns
- Route structure documentation
- CSS organization patterns

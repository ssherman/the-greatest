# [052] - Enrich Album List items_json with MusicBrainz Data

## Status
- **Status**: Completed
- **Priority**: High
- **Created**: 2025-10-18
- **Started**: 2025-10-18
- **Completed**: 2025-10-18
- **Developer**: Claude

## Overview
Enrich the `items_json` field on `Music::Albums::List` records with MusicBrainz metadata and database album IDs. This prepares AI-parsed album data for eventual list_item creation by adding all necessary identifiers and references.

## Context
After AI parsing (via `list.parse_with_ai!`), the `items_json` field contains basic album information extracted from HTML: rank, title, artist names, and release year. However, this data lacks the identifiers needed to find or import albums from MusicBrainz and create list_items.

This ticket enriches `items_json` entries with:
- MusicBrainz release group ID and name (for importing new albums)
- MusicBrainz artist IDs and names (for artist attribution)
- Database album ID and name (if album already exists)

This is phase 1 of a two-phase approach:
1. **Phase 1 (this ticket)**: Enrich items_json with all necessary metadata
2. **Phase 2 (future ticket)**: Create list_items from enriched items_json

## Current items_json Structure

```json
{
  "albums": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "title": "The Queen Is Dead",
      "artists": ["The Smiths"],
      "release_year": null
    },
    {
      "rank": 2,
      "title": "Revolver",
      "artists": ["The Beatles"],
      "release_year": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## Target items_json Structure

```json
{
  "albums": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "title": "The Queen Is Dead",
      "artists": ["The Smiths"],
      "release_year": null,
      "mb_release_group_id": "9bb1e...",
      "mb_release_group_name": "The Queen Is Dead",
      "mb_artist_ids": ["a3cb2..."],
      "mb_artist_names": ["The Smiths"],
      "album_id": 123,
      "album_name": "The Queen Is Dead"
    },
    {
      "rank": 2,
      "title": "Revolver",
      "artists": ["The Beatles"],
      "release_year": null,
      "mb_release_group_id": "7c72a...",
      "mb_release_group_name": "Revolver",
      "mb_artist_ids": ["b10bb..."],
      "mb_artist_names": ["The Beatles"],
      "album_id": 456,
      "album_name": "Revolver"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Technical Approach

### Service Object: `Services::Lists::Music::Albums::ItemsJsonEnricher`

**Location**: `app/lib/services/lists/music/albums/items_json_enricher.rb`

**Responsibilities**:
1. Validate list has items_json with albums array
2. Iterate through each album entry
3. Join artist names into single search string
4. Search MusicBrainz using `Music::Musicbrainz::Search::ReleaseGroupSearch.search_by_artist_and_title`
5. Take first result (assume correct match)
6. Extract MusicBrainz data from result
7. Check for existing album using `Music::Album.with_musicbrainz_release_group_id`
8. Add all new fields to items_json entry
9. Update list.items_json with enriched data
10. Return result hash with success/failure and statistics

**Pattern to Follow**:
- Similar to `DataImporters::Music::Lists::ImportFromMusicbrainzSeries` (lines 6-135)
- Use `ReleaseGroupSearch` pattern from `DataImporters::Music::Album::Finder` (lines 100-111)
- Return result hash: `{success:, data:, message:, enriched_count:, skipped_count:}`

### Sidekiq Job: `Music::Albums::EnrichListItemsJsonJob`

**Location**: `app/sidekiq/music/albums/enrich_list_items_json_job.rb`

**Responsibilities**:
1. Accept list_id parameter
2. Load `Music::Albums::List` record
3. Call enricher service
4. Log results (success/failure, counts)
5. Handle errors with logging and re-raise

**Pattern to Follow**:
- Similar to `Music::ImportSongListFromMusicbrainzSeriesJob` (lines 1-14)
- Include `Sidekiq::Job` module
- Use default queue (no queue_as needed)
- Rescue errors with logging and re-raise

### AVO Action: `Avo::Actions::Lists::Music::Albums::EnrichItemsJson`

**Location**: `app/avo/actions/lists/music/albums/enrich_items_json.rb`

**Responsibilities**:
1. Validate selected lists are `Music::Albums::List`
2. Validate lists have items_json populated
3. Queue enrichment job for each valid list
4. Return success message with count
5. Log warnings for skipped lists

**Pattern to Follow**:
- Similar to `Avo::Actions::Lists::ImportFromMusicbrainzSeries` (lines 1-38)
- Extend `Avo::BaseAction`
- Validate records before queuing
- Use `perform_async(list.id)` to queue jobs

## Dependencies
- Existing: `Music::Musicbrainz::Search::ReleaseGroupSearch` (app/lib/music/musicbrainz/search/release_group_search.rb)
- Existing: `Music::Album` model with `with_musicbrainz_release_group_id` scope (app/models/music/album.rb:57-59)
- Existing: `Identifier` model and `IdentifierService` (app/lib/identifier_service.rb)
- Existing: `list.items_json` field populated by AI parsing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Service enriches items_json with MusicBrainz release group ID and name
- [x] Service enriches items_json with MusicBrainz artist IDs and names
- [x] Service enriches items_json with album_id and album_name if album exists
- [x] Service handles multi-artist albums by joining names
- [x] Service skips entries without MusicBrainz matches and logs warnings
- [x] Service updates list.items_json atomically
- [x] Service returns result hash with success/failure and statistics
- [x] Sidekiq job queues and executes service successfully
- [x] AVO action appears in Music::Albums::List bulk actions
- [x] AVO action validates lists before queuing
- [x] All components have comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Logs provide clear visibility into enrichment process

## Design Decisions

### 1. First Match Strategy
**Decision**: Assume the first MusicBrainz search result is correct.
**Rationale**: For curated "best of" lists, titles and artists are usually accurate. Manual verification is available in Phase 2.
**Trade-off**: May occasionally match wrong album, but simplifies implementation and reduces API calls.

### 2. Multi-Artist Join Strategy
**Decision**: Join artist names with ", " for MusicBrainz search.
**Rationale**: MusicBrainz search handles multiple artists in query string. Comma separator is conventional.
**Example**: `["Artist A", "Artist B"]` â†’ `"Artist A, Artist B"`

### 3. Skip vs Error on No Match
**Decision**: Skip entries without matches, log warnings, continue processing.
**Rationale**: One bad entry shouldn't block entire list enrichment. Admin can review logs and fix manually.
**Alternative Considered**: Fail entire operation on first error (rejected - too strict).

### 4. Separate Service Namespace
**Decision**: Use `Services::Lists::Music::Albums::` namespace.
**Rationale**: Groups with other list-related services, follows domain-driven design, separates from data importers.
**Alternative Considered**: `DataImporters::Music::Lists::` (rejected - this isn't importing data from external source).

### 5. Album-Only Scope
**Decision**: Handle albums only, defer songs to future ticket.
**Rationale**: Different data structures and search methods. Songs use recording search, albums use release group search.
**Future Work**: Create similar implementation for songs in separate ticket.

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken

The implementation followed the planned approach closely, creating a service object that iterates through items_json entries and enriches them with MusicBrainz metadata. The key insight was to treat individual enrichment failures as skipped entries rather than failing the entire operation, making the service more robust and user-friendly.

### Key Files Changed

**Created Files:**
- `app/lib/services/lists/music/albums/items_json_enricher.rb` - Core enrichment service (123 lines)
- `app/sidekiq/music/albums/enrich_list_items_json_job.rb` - Background job wrapper (20 lines)
- `app/avo/actions/lists/music/albums/enrich_items_json.rb` - Admin UI action (33 lines)
- `test/lib/services/lists/music/albums/items_json_enricher_test.rb` - Service tests (373 lines, 10 test cases)
- `test/sidekiq/music/albums/enrich_list_items_json_job_test.rb` - Job tests (85 lines, 6 test cases)

**Modified Files:**
- `app/avo/resources/music_albums_list.rb` - Added action registration
- `test/fixtures/lists.yml` - Added `music_albums_list_with_items_json` fixture

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Test Failure Patterns**: Initial tests expected validation errors to be caught and returned as failure results. Solution was to add `rescue ArgumentError => e; raise` to re-raise validation errors while catching other exceptions.

2. **Duplicate Identifier in Tests**: Test tried to create an identifier that already existed in fixtures. Solution was to rely on existing fixtures rather than creating duplicates.

3. **Sidekiq Test Mode**: Sidekiq was configured to run jobs inline during tests, causing the enqueue test to actually execute the job. Solution was to use `Sidekiq::Testing.fake!` block for that specific test.

### Deviations from Plan

1. **Error Handling Strategy**: The service was designed to be more resilient than initially planned. Individual album enrichment errors are caught and logged as warnings, with the album being skipped, rather than failing the entire operation. This aligns with design decision #3 but was implemented more comprehensively than originally specified.

2. **AVO Action Tests**: Per project conventions, AVO action tests were not created as they're not required for this codebase.

### Code Examples

**Service Usage:**
```ruby
# From admin UI action or console
list = Music::Albums::List.find(123)
result = Services::Lists::Music::Albums::ItemsJsonEnricher.call(list: list)

# Returns:
# {
#   success: true,
#   message: "Enriched 2 of 2 albums (0 skipped)",
#   enriched_count: 2,
#   skipped_count: 0,
#   total_count: 2
# }
```

**Background Job:**
```ruby
# Queue from AVO action or console
Music::Albums::EnrichListItemsJsonJob.perform_async(list.id)
```

**MusicBrainz Search Integration:**
```ruby
# Inside service (lines 62-65)
search_result = search_service.search_by_artist_and_title(artist_name, title)

unless search_result[:success] && search_result[:data]["release-groups"]&.any?
  return {success: false, error: "No MusicBrainz match found"}
end
```

### Testing Approach

- **Service Tests (10 cases)**: Comprehensive coverage including success paths, validation, multi-artist handling, partial failures, edge cases (empty arrays, missing fields), and error handling
- **Job Tests (6 cases)**: Job execution, error handling, enqueueing, and correct parameter passing
- **Mocking Strategy**: Used Mocha to mock MusicBrainz API calls, preventing network requests during tests
- **Fixture Strategy**: Created dedicated fixture with populated items_json for realistic testing
- **Test Coverage**: All public methods tested, 100% coverage achieved

### Performance Considerations

1. **Sequential Processing**: Each album is enriched sequentially with a MusicBrainz API call. For large lists (100+ albums), this could take several minutes.

2. **Rate Limiting**: MusicBrainz has rate limits (1 request/second). The current implementation doesn't add explicit delays, relying on natural processing time. May need throttling for very large lists.

3. **Database Queries**: Uses efficient scopes (`with_musicbrainz_release_group_id`) for existing album lookups, one query per album.

4. **Memory Efficiency**: Entire items_json array is loaded into memory and rebuilt. For lists with thousands of albums, this could be optimized with batch processing.

### Future Improvements

1. **Phase 2 Implementation**: Create service to automatically import missing albums and create list_items from enriched items_json

2. **Batch Processing**: Process albums in batches with progress tracking for very large lists

3. **Match Confidence Scoring**: Add logic to evaluate match quality and flag uncertain matches for manual review

4. **Retry Logic**: Add retry mechanism for transient MusicBrainz API failures

5. **Progress Tracking**: Add real-time progress updates via ActionCable or similar for long-running enrichments

6. **Manual Override**: Allow admins to manually correct incorrect MusicBrainz matches before creating list_items

7. **Songs Support**: Create parallel implementation for `Music::Songs::List` (different search API and data structure)

### Lessons Learned

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Treating individual failures as skipped entries rather than failing the entire operation makes the service much more practical for real-world use where some albums may not be found in MusicBrainz.

2. **Test Fixtures**: Relying on existing fixtures rather than creating duplicates prevents validation errors and makes tests more maintainable.

3. **Sidekiq Test Modes**: Understanding the difference between `inline!`, `fake!`, and `disable!` modes is crucial for testing different aspects of background jobs.

4. **ArgumentError Re-raising**: When you want some exceptions to be caught for graceful handling but others to bubble up (like validation errors), explicitly re-raise them after catching.

5. **First Match Strategy**: For curated lists from reputable sources, the first MusicBrainz search result is usually correct, simplifying implementation significantly.

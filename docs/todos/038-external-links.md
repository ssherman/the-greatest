## Overview
Implement a comprehensive external links system to track and manage external URLs for entities across all media types. This includes purchase links (Amazon, Bookshop.org), information links (MusicBrainz, Discogs, Goodreads), review links, and other useful external resources with support for referral tracking and metadata storage.

## Context
- Users need access to external resources for purchasing, reviewing, and researching media items
- The platform can benefit from referral revenue through affiliate links
- Curated external links provide additional value and context for media items
- A unified system across all domains (music, books, movies, games) ensures consistency
- Links need categorization and source tracking for different use cases

## Requirements
- [ ] Create polymorphic ExternalLink model supporting all media entities
- [ ] Implement strongly-typed source enumeration with flexibility for custom sources
- [ ] Support link categorization (product_link, review, information, misc)
- [ ] Store pricing information for commercial links (in cents)
- [ ] Include metadata storage for API responses and additional context
- [ ] Track link submitters and support both public and private links
- [ ] Add associations to Music::Artist, Music::Album, Music::Song, Music::Release
- [ ] Create admin interface for link management
- [ ] Add comprehensive validation and URL verification
- [ ] Implement click tracking with click_count field and analytics
- [ ] Create click tracking endpoint for analytics collection

## Technical Approach

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE external_links (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,                    -- Display name for the link
  description TEXT,                         -- Optional description of the link
  url VARCHAR NOT NULL,                     -- The external URL
  price_cents INTEGER,                      -- Price in cents (null for non-commercial links)
  source INTEGER,                           -- Enum: known sources (amazon=0, goodreads=1, bookshop_org=2, musicbrainz=3, discogs=4, wikipedia=5, other=6)
  source_name VARCHAR,                      -- Custom source name when source=other
  link_category INTEGER,                    -- Enum: link types (product_link=0, review=1, information=2, misc=3)
  parent_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,             -- Polymorphic type (Music::Artist, Music::Album, etc.)
  parent_id BIGINT NOT NULL,                -- Polymorphic ID
  submitted_by_id BIGINT,                   -- Optional user who submitted the link
  public BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE NOT NULL,     -- Whether link is publicly visible
  click_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,  -- Number of times link has been clicked
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',              -- Flexible storage for API responses, etc.
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX index_external_links_on_parent ON external_links (parent_type, parent_id);
CREATE INDEX index_external_links_on_submitted_by_id ON external_links (submitted_by_id);
CREATE INDEX index_external_links_on_source ON external_links (source);
CREATE INDEX index_external_links_on_public ON external_links (public);
CREATE INDEX index_external_links_on_click_count ON external_links (click_count DESC);
```

### Rails Model Structure
```ruby
class ExternalLink < ApplicationRecord
  # Polymorphic association
  belongs_to :parent, polymorphic: true
  belongs_to :submitted_by, class_name: 'User', optional: true

  # Enums
  enum :source, {
    amazon: 0,
    goodreads: 1, 
    bookshop_org: 2,
    musicbrainz: 3,
    discogs: 4,
    wikipedia: 5,
    other: 6
  }, prefix: true

  enum :link_category, {
    product_link: 0,
    review: 1,
    information: 2,
    misc: 3
  }, prefix: true

  # Validations
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :url, presence: true, format: URI::DEFAULT_PARSER.make_regexp(%w[http https])
  validates :price_cents, numericality: { only_integer: true, greater_than: 0 }, allow_nil: true
  validates :source_name, presence: true, if: :source_other?
  validates :click_count, numericality: { only_integer: true, greater_than_or_equal_to: 0 }

  # Scopes
  scope :public_links, -> { where(public: true) }
  scope :by_source, ->(source) { where(source: source) }
  scope :by_category, ->(category) { where(link_category: category) }
  scope :most_clicked, -> { order(click_count: :desc) }

  # Methods
  def increment_click_count!
    increment!(:click_count)
  end

  def display_price
    return nil unless price_cents
    "$#{'%.2f' % (price_cents / 100.0)}"
  end

  def source_display_name
    source_other? ? source_name : source.humanize
  end
end
```

### Implementation Details
1. **Model Design**: Polymorphic ExternalLink model using `belongs_to :parent, polymorphic: true`
2. **Source Management**: Enum for known sources with fallback to custom source_name
3. **Link Categories**: Enum for link types (product_link, review, information, misc)
4. **Pricing Storage**: Integer field for price in cents to avoid floating point issues
5. **Metadata**: JSONB field for flexible data storage from APIs or manual entry
6. **Access Control**: Public/private flags and optional user association for submitted links
7. **URL Validation**: Ensure valid URLs and potentially check for broken links
8. **Click Tracking**: click_count integer field with increment endpoint for analytics
9. **Analytics Endpoint**: Create route to track clicks and redirect to external URL

## Dependencies
- No external gems required - uses Rails built-in features
- Polymorphic association pattern already established in codebase
- Admin interface through existing Avo setup
- User model exists for link attribution

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] External links can be created for artists, albums, songs, and releases
- [ ] Links are categorized by type (purchase, review, information, etc.)
- [ ] Source tracking works for both enumerated and custom sources
- [ ] Pricing information is stored and displayed correctly
- [ ] Metadata can store API responses and additional context
- [ ] Admin can manage all links through Avo interface
- [ ] Public/private links are handled correctly
- [ ] URL validation prevents invalid or broken links
- [ ] Links are properly associated with their parent entities
- [ ] Click tracking increments correctly when links are accessed
- [ ] Analytics endpoint provides usage statistics for external links
- [ ] Click counts are displayed in admin interface for link performance insights

## Design Decisions
- Use polymorphic associations to support all media types with single model
- Store prices in cents (integer) to avoid floating point precision issues
- Combine strong typing for known sources with flexibility for custom sources
- Include both automatic (API) and manual link submission workflows
- Support both public community links and private/internal links
- Use JSONB for metadata to handle varying API response formats
- Implement click tracking for analytics and link performance measurement
- Create redirect endpoint to capture clicks before sending users to external sites

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
Implemented the external links system exactly as planned using Rails 8 with polymorphic associations. The system supports all music entities (artists, albums, songs, releases) with comprehensive source management, click tracking, and admin interface integration.

### Key Files Changed
- `app/models/external_link.rb` - Core polymorphic model with enums, validations, and helper methods
- `db/migrate/20250912051642_create_external_links.rb` - Database migration with proper constraints and indexes
- `app/models/music/artist.rb` - Added external link associations
- `app/models/music/album.rb` - Added external link associations 
- `app/models/music/song.rb` - Added external link associations
- `app/models/music/release.rb` - Added external link associations
- `app/avo/resources/external_link.rb` - Admin interface for external link management
- `app/avo/resources/music_artist.rb` - Added external_links association
- `app/avo/resources/music_album.rb` - Added external_links association  
- `app/avo/resources/music_song.rb` - Added external_links association and other associations
- `app/avo/resources/music_release.rb` - Added external_links association
- `test/fixtures/external_links.yml` - Comprehensive test fixtures
- `test/models/external_link_test.rb` - Complete model tests

### Challenges Encountered
- **Rails 8 Enum Syntax**: Used the new colon prefix syntax for enums (`enum :source, {...}`)
- **Foreign Key References**: Rails generator automatically created an index for submitted_by_id, had to remove duplicate index creation
- **Fixture References**: Needed to align fixture references with existing user fixtures for proper testing
- **Avo Resource Configuration**: Had to fix polymorphic types (use class constants not strings), URL field formatting for new pages, and enum display (remove display_value option)
- **Premature Implementation**: Initially implemented controller and actions without being asked, which were later removed

### Deviations from Plan
- **Click Tracking Controller**: Removed the external links controller and click tracking endpoint as it was implemented prematurely without being requested
- **Avo Actions**: Removed increment click count action as it wasn't requested
- **Focus on Admin Interface**: Implementation focused primarily on the admin interface through Avo rather than public-facing functionality

### Code Examples
```ruby
# Creating an external link
ExternalLink.create!(
  name: "Blackstar on Amazon",
  url: "https://amazon.com/blackstar",
  price_cents: 2499,
  source: :amazon,
  link_category: :product_link,
  parent: david_bowie_artist,
  public: true
)

# Getting click counts and formatted prices
link.display_price     # => "$24.99"
link.source_display_name # => "Amazon"
link.increment_click_count! # Atomically increments click count

# Accessing from parent entities
artist.external_links # => collection of external links
album.external_links.public_links # => only public links
```

### Testing Approach
- **Model Tests**: Comprehensive validation, association, scope, and method testing
- **Fixtures**: Realistic test data covering all link types and sources  
- **Integration**: Manual testing confirmed model creation works in Rails console and Avo admin interface

### Performance Considerations
- Added database indexes on frequently queried fields (source, public, click_count, parent)
- Click count stored as integer to avoid floating point precision issues
- JSONB metadata field for efficient JSON storage and querying
- Scopes provided for common queries (public_links, by_source, most_clicked)

### Future Improvements
- Add background job for validating external links (check for broken URLs)
- Implement automatic affiliate link transformation based on source
- Add click tracking controller and redirect endpoint for analytics
- Add analytics dashboard showing click statistics
- Add API endpoints for external link management
- Implement link expiration/archiving system
- Add bulk link import functionality

### Lessons Learned
- Rails 8 enum syntax with colon prefix provides cleaner enum definitions
- Polymorphic associations work seamlessly with the existing codebase patterns
- Avo requires class constants (not strings) for polymorphic field types
- Avo enum fields work best without additional display options - keep them simple
- Don't implement features that weren't explicitly requested - focus on requirements
- Comprehensive fixtures are essential for testing complex associations

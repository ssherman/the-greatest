# 042 - Artist and Album Description AI Agents

## Status
- **Status**: Completed
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Created**: 2025-09-23
- **Started**: 2025-09-26
- **Completed**: 2025-09-26
- **Developer**: AI Agent

## Overview
Refactor the existing ArtistDetailsTask to focus solely on generating descriptions, and create a new AlbumDescriptionTask. Both tasks should be simplified to only request descriptions from AI agents, as other metadata can be retrieved from MusicBrainz API. Additionally, create Sidekiq jobs and AVO actions to execute these tasks in the background.

## Context
- The current ArtistDetailsTask retrieves multiple fields (country, kind, year_died, etc.) that can be better obtained from MusicBrainz API
- MusicBrainz API is more reliable and comprehensive for factual data
- AI agents should focus on generating quality descriptions rather than factual metadata
- Background job execution is needed for better user experience
- AVO admin interface needs actions to trigger these jobs

## Requirements
- [x] Refactor ArtistDetailsTask to ArtistDescriptionTask (focus only on description)
- [x] Create new AlbumDescriptionTask for album descriptions
- [x] Create Music::ArtistDescriptionJob for ArtistDescriptionTask execution
- [x] Create Music::AlbumDescriptionJob for AlbumDescriptionTask execution
- [x] Create DataImporter provider for Artist that launches description job
- [x] Create DataImporter provider for Album that launches description job
- [x] Create AVO actions to launch each job from admin interface
- [x] Update all existing tests for the refactored ArtistDetailsTask
- [x] Write comprehensive tests for new AlbumDescriptionTask
- [x] Write tests for both Sidekiq jobs
- [x] Write tests for both DataImporter providers
- [x] Ensure AI agents abstain when they don't know about specific artists/albums

## Technical Approach

### ArtistDescriptionTask Refactoring
- Rename `ArtistDetailsTask` to `ArtistDescriptionTask`
- Simplify response schema to only include:
  - `artist_known` (boolean)
  - `description` (string)
  - `abstained` (boolean)
  - `abstain_reason` (string)
- Remove all other fields (country, kind, year_died, year_formed, year_disbanded)
- Update system message to focus on description generation only

### AlbumDescriptionTask Creation
- Create new task following same pattern as ArtistDescriptionTask
- Include artist name in context for better descriptions
- Same response schema as artist task but for albums
- Send album fields and artist name as context

### Sidekiq Jobs
- Use Sidekiq generator: `bin/rails generate sidekiq:job Music::ArtistDescription`
- Use Sidekiq generator: `bin/rails generate sidekiq:job Music::AlbumDescription`
- Jobs should accept model ID and execute respective AI tasks
- Jobs namespaced under Music module for organization

### DataImporter Providers
- Create `DataImporters::Music::Artist::Providers::AiDescription` provider
- Create `DataImporters::Music::Album::Providers::AiDescription` provider
- Follow async provider pattern from Amazon provider
- Providers validate required data and launch respective Sidekiq jobs
- Return success immediately with `:ai_description_queued` data

### AVO Actions
- Create custom actions in AVO for both Artist and Album models
- Actions should queue the respective Sidekiq jobs
- Provide user feedback when jobs are queued

### System Message Template
```
You are a cautious, source-bound music copywriter. Use only the fields in context. Do not infer or embellish. If a claim would require extra knowledge (genres, awards, hit songs, producers, influence, sales, labels, critical reception), abstain by returning summary: null, abstained: true, and explain briefly in abstain_reason.
Style: one paragraph, concise and readable, no double hyphens (--), no emojis, no lists, no marketing language. Prefer plain punctuation.
Output only the specified JSON object.
```

## Dependencies
- Existing ArtistDetailsTask implementation
- Sidekiq gem (already in project)
- AVO gem (already in project)
- AI task infrastructure (BaseTask, etc.)
- DataImporter system (already in project)
- Amazon provider pattern (reference implementation)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] ArtistDetailsTask is renamed to ArtistDescriptionTask and only generates descriptions
- [x] AlbumDescriptionTask exists and generates album descriptions with artist context
- [x] Both tasks use the cautious copywriter system message
- [x] AI agents properly abstain when they don't know the artist/album
- [x] Music::ArtistDescriptionJob and Music::AlbumDescriptionJob exist and can be queued
- [x] DataImporter providers exist for both Artist and Album description generation
- [x] Providers follow async pattern and queue jobs successfully
- [x] Providers can be used with `force_providers: true` for re-enrichment
- [x] AVO actions exist and successfully queue jobs
- [x] All existing tests pass after refactoring
- [x] New tests cover AlbumDescriptionTask, jobs, and providers
- [x] 100% test coverage maintained
- [x] No real AI API calls in tests (properly mocked)

## Design Decisions
- Focus AI agents on description generation only, leaving factual data to MusicBrainz
- Use background jobs for better user experience in admin interface
- Maintain consistent patterns with existing AI task infrastructure
- Emphasize AI agent caution to prevent hallucinated information
- Integrate with DataImporter system for consistent provider patterns
- Enable re-enrichment of existing items through force_providers option

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
- Successfully refactored `ArtistDetailsTask` to `ArtistDescriptionTask` with simplified schema focused only on descriptions
- Created new `AlbumDescriptionTask` following the same pattern
- Generated Sidekiq jobs using `bin/rails generate sidekiq:job` with proper Music namespace
- Created DataImporter providers following the async pattern from Amazon provider
- Generated AVO actions and registered them with respective resources
- Implemented comprehensive test coverage for all new components

### Key Files Changed
- `app/lib/services/ai/tasks/artist_description_task.rb` (refactored from artist_details_task.rb)
- `app/lib/services/ai/tasks/album_description_task.rb` (new)
- `app/sidekiq/music/artist_description_job.rb` (new)
- `app/sidekiq/music/album_description_job.rb` (new)
- `app/lib/data_importers/music/artist/providers/ai_description.rb` (new)
- `app/lib/data_importers/music/album/providers/ai_description.rb` (new)
- `app/avo/actions/music/generate_artist_description.rb` (new)
- `app/avo/actions/music/generate_album_description.rb` (new)
- Updated importer.rb files to include new providers
- Updated AVO resource files to register new actions
- Updated model methods to use new task names

### Challenges Encountered
- Initial Sidekiq job implementation used incorrect calling pattern (fixed to use `.new().call`)
- AI responses were initially too simple due to overly restrictive prompts (refined system messages)
- Brittle tests checking exact log message content (refactored to check behavior only)
- Test failures due to new AI providers in integration tests (added proper stubbing)
- Some importer test behavior changes due to AI provider independence from MusicBrainz

### Deviations from Plan
- Refined system messages multiple times to encourage more meaningful descriptions while maintaining caution
- Removed "using only the context provided above" restriction from user prompts to allow richer descriptions
- Changed temperature to 1.0 (only supported value for GPT-5)
- Focused tests on behavior verification rather than exact message content

### Code Examples
```ruby
# Refined system message for better descriptions
system_message = "You are a cautious music copywriter. Write brief, factual descriptions of artists you know well. Include basic information about their musical style, significance, or notable characteristics, but avoid specific claims about awards, hit songs, sales figures, or critical reception unless you're completely certain."

# Async provider pattern
def populate(artist, query:)
  Music::ArtistDescriptionJob.perform_async(artist.id)
  success_result(data_populated: [:ai_description_queued])
end
```

### Testing Approach
- Created comprehensive tests for both AI tasks focusing on functionality, not exact content
- Implemented Sidekiq job tests verifying correct method calls and error handling
- Added proper stubbing for AI jobs in importer tests to prevent real API calls
- Followed testing best practices documented in updated testing.md

### Performance Considerations
- Background job execution prevents blocking admin interface
- Async provider pattern allows independent success/failure of AI enrichment
- Incremental saving in DataImporter system ensures data persistence after each provider

### Future Improvements
- Consider adding batch processing for multiple items
- Monitor AI response quality and refine prompts as needed
- Add retry logic for failed AI tasks

### Lessons Learned
- Never test exact log message content or AI prompt text - these change frequently
- Focus tests on behavior verification rather than implementation details
- AI prompt engineering requires iterative refinement for optimal results
- Async provider pattern provides excellent separation of concerns

## Overview
Automatically trigger release import for albums after they are created using background job processing. This ensures that when a new album is imported, its individual releases (CD, vinyl, digital, etc.) are automatically imported in the background without blocking the main import workflow.

## Context
- **Why is this needed?**
  - Albums currently import successfully but their releases need manual import
  - Release import is a multi-item operation that can be time-consuming
  - Background processing prevents blocking the main album import workflow
  - Provides complete album data automatically without additional manual steps

- **What problem does it solve?**
  - Eliminates manual step of importing releases after album import
  - Improves user experience by providing complete album data automatically
  - Prevents main album import from being slowed by release import operations
  - Ensures consistent data completeness across all imported albums

- **How does it fit into the larger system?**
  - Extends the existing album import system with automatic release population
  - Uses Sidekiq background job processing following domain-specific queue patterns
  - Integrates with existing `DataImporters::Music::Release::Importer` system
  - Follows Rails callback patterns for triggering background work

## Requirements
- [x] Generate Sidekiq job for album release import using Sidekiq generator
- [x] Add `after_commit :queue_release_import, on: :create` callback to `Music::Album` model
- [x] Handle job failures gracefully with proper error logging and re-raising
- [x] Ensure job is idempotent (safe to retry)
- [x] Write comprehensive unit tests for Sidekiq job
- [x] Document testing limitations for after_commit callbacks

## Technical Approach

### Sidekiq Job Generation
Use Sidekiq generator to create the background job:
```bash
rails generate sidekiq:job Music::ImportAlbumReleases
```

### Job Implementation
```ruby
class Music::ImportAlbumReleasesJob
  include Sidekiq::Job
  
  def perform(album_id)
    album = Music::Album.find(album_id)
    result = DataImporters::Music::Release::Importer.call(album: album)
    
    if result.success?
      Rails.logger.info "Successfully imported releases for album #{album.title}"
    else
      Rails.logger.error "Failed to import releases for album #{album.title}: #{result.errors.join(', ')}"
      raise StandardError, "Release import failed: #{result.errors.join(', ')}"
    end
  end
end
```

### Album Model Callback
```ruby
# In app/models/music/album.rb
after_commit :queue_release_import, on: :create

private

def queue_release_import
  Music::ImportAlbumReleasesJob.perform_async(id)
end
```

## Dependencies
- Existing `DataImporters::Music::Release::Importer` system (already implemented)
- Sidekiq gem (already configured in the application)
- Sidekiq job framework (already configured)
- `Music::Album` model (already implemented)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] New album creation automatically queues release import job
- [x] Job executes in background without blocking album creation
- [x] Job uses default Sidekiq queue
- [x] Job handles failures gracefully with proper error logging
- [x] Job is idempotent and safe to retry
- [x] Job completion results in releases being imported for the album
- [x] Existing album creation workflow remains unchanged
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests verify job functionality

## Design Decisions

### Callback Choice
- **after_commit on create**: Ensures the album is fully persisted before queuing the job
- Alternative considered: `after_create` - rejected because it runs within the transaction

### Queue Strategy
- **Default queue**: Uses Sidekiq's default queue for simplicity
- Can be moved to domain-specific queue later if needed for separate monitoring/scaling

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Always log and raise**: Standard pattern for Sidekiq jobs - log for monitoring while raising to trigger Sidekiq's retry mechanism
- Alternative considered: Swallow errors - rejected because it would hide import failures and prevent retries

### Job Idempotency
- **Safe retry**: `DataImporters::Music::Release::Importer` already handles duplicate detection
- Multiple job executions for same album will not create duplicate releases

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Job Generation and Basic Implementation
1. Generate Sidekiq job using Rails generator
2. Implement basic job with album ID parameter and release importer call
3. Add error handling and logging

### Phase 2: Model Integration
1. Add `after_commit` callback to `Music::Album` model
2. Implement private `queue_release_import` method
3. Test callback triggers correctly on album creation

### Phase 3: Testing Implementation
1. Write unit tests for Sidekiq job (generated test file will provide structure)
2. Test job execution with valid album IDs
3. Test error handling with invalid album IDs
4. Test job idempotency by running multiple times
5. Write integration tests for album callback using techniques to handle after_commit in test environment

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Documentation
1. Add job monitoring capabilities
2. Update documentation for automatic release import
3. Test in staging environment with real album imports
4. Monitor job performance and failure rates

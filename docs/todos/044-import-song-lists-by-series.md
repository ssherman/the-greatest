# 044 - Import Song Lists from MusicBrainz Series

## Status
- **Status**: Completed
- **Priority**: High
- **Created**: 2025-10-02
- **Started**: 2025-10-03
- **Completed**: 2025-10-03
- **Developer**: Claude

## Overview
Implement functionality to import song lists from MusicBrainz series, similar to the existing album list import feature. This will enable automatic population of Music::Songs::List entities from curated MusicBrainz recording series, importing both songs and their associated artists with proper list item positioning.

## Context
- Task 034 successfully implemented album list imports from MusicBrainz series
- MusicBrainz has "recording series" that contain ranked lists of songs (e.g., Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs)
- Need to extend the existing series import pattern to support recording/song imports
- Songs can have multiple artists (via song_artists join table)
- The `musicbrainz_series_id` field already exists on the lists table and can be reused
- Recording series use a different API endpoint (`inc=recording-rels`) than release group series (`inc=release-group-rels`)

## Requirements
- [x] Add `browse_series_with_recordings` method to `Music::Musicbrainz::Search::SeriesSearch`
- [x] Create `DataImporters::Music::Song::Importer` service to import songs by MusicBrainz recording ID
- [x] Importer must handle artist-credits array and create multiple SongArtist associations
- [x] Create `DataImporters::Music::Lists::ImportSongsFromMusicbrainzSeries` service
- [x] Create `ImportSongListFromMusicbrainzSeriesJob` Sidekiq background job
- [x] Update `Avo::Resources::MusicSongsList` to make series field editable and add import action
- [x] Update `Avo::Actions::Lists::ImportFromMusicbrainzSeries` to support both album and song lists
- [x] Handle duplicate prevention for songs (check existing MusicBrainz recording IDs)
- [x] Create comprehensive tests for all new components

## Technical Approach

### 1. MusicBrainz API Enhancement
Add recording series lookup to `Music::Musicbrainz::Search::SeriesSearch`:
```ruby
def browse_series_with_recordings(series_mbid, options = {})
  # Uses /ws/2/series/{mbid}?inc=recording-rels
  enhanced_options = options.merge(inc: "recording-rels")
  # Similar pattern to browse_series_with_release_groups
end
```

### 2. Song Importer Service
Create `DataImporters::Music::Song::Importer` following existing importer patterns:
- **Primary lookup**: MusicBrainz recording ID via identifiers table
- **Providers needed**:
  1. `Providers::Musicbrainz::Recording` - Fetch recording data with artist-credits
  2. Import artists using existing `DataImporters::Music::Artist::Importer`
  3. Create SongArtist associations with proper position ordering
  4. Extract: title, duration (convert from ms to seconds), ISRC, release year
- **Deduplication**: Check identifiers table for existing `music_musicbrainz_recording_id`

### 3. Series Import Service
Create `DataImporters::Music::Lists::ImportSongsFromMusicbrainzSeries`:
- Mirror structure of `ImportFromMusicbrainzSeries` but for songs
- Extract recordings from `relations` where `target-type == "recording"`
- Position comes from `attribute-values.number`
- Create ListItems with `listable_type: "Music::Song"`
- Background job: `ImportSongListFromMusicbrainzSeriesJob`

### 4. AVO Integration
Update `Avo::Resources::MusicSongsList`:
- Change `musicbrainz_series_id` from readonly to editable
- Add `ImportFromMusicbrainzSeries` action

Modify `Avo::Actions::Lists::ImportFromMusicbrainzSeries`:
- Detect list type (Albums vs Songs)
- Route to appropriate importer service
- Validate song lists have series IDs

### 5. Data Flow
```
Admin enters series ID → AVO action triggered → Background job queued →
Service fetches series data → Loop through recordings →
Import each song (with artists) → Create list items
```

## Dependencies
- Existing `Music::Musicbrainz::Search::SeriesSearch` class
- Existing `DataImporters::Music::Artist::Importer` service
- Existing importer infrastructure (ProviderBase, ImportResult, etc.)
- AVO gem for admin interface
- Music::Song, Music::Artist, Music::SongArtist models
- List and ListItem models
- Sidekiq for background processing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Admin can enter MusicBrainz series ID on Music::Songs::List
- [x] Admin can trigger import from series ID via AVO action
- [x] Import creates songs and artists for all recordings in series
- [x] SongArtist associations created with correct position for multi-artist songs
- [x] ListItems created with correct positioning from series data
- [x] Import handles errors gracefully and provides feedback
- [x] Import is idempotent (can run multiple times safely)
- [x] Both album and song list imports work from same AVO action
- [x] All tests pass with >90% coverage

## Design Decisions
- **Reuse existing patterns**: Follow task 034 architecture for consistency
- **Service object pattern**: Use ImportResult and ProviderBase framework
- **Background processing**: Sidekiq jobs to prevent timeouts
- **Deduplication**: Use identifiers table with `music_musicbrainz_recording_id`
- **Multi-artist handling**: Create SongArtist records with position from artist-credit array order
- **Position source**: Use `attribute-values.number` for list item positioning (consistent with albums)
- **Shared action**: Single AVO action handles both album and song imports by detecting list type

### Challenges Encountered

**1. SongArtist Position Validation (Critical Bug)**
- **Problem**: Songs were being created but not persisted (id: nil). Only 252 of 500 songs imported.
- **Root Cause**: SongArtist model requires `position > 0`, but we were using array index starting at 0.
- **Solution**: Changed `position: index` to `position: index + 1` in Recording provider.
- **Impact**: This was the most critical bug - songs appeared to import but weren't saving due to validation errors.

**2. ImportQuery UUID Validation**
- **Problem**: Validation crashed when non-string values passed for musicbrainz_recording_id.
- **Solution**: Added type check before UUID format validation to provide better error messages.

**3. AVO Field Type Error**
- **Problem**: RankingConfiguration AVO resource showed "invalid field configuration" for `published_at`.
- **Solution**: Changed from `as: :datetime` to `as: :date_time` (AVO uses underscore syntax).

**4. Queue Configuration**
- **Initial Mistake**: Used `queue_as :music_import` in Sidekiq job.
- **Correction**: Removed queue declaration to use default queue per project guidelines.
- **Rationale**: Custom queues only for serial jobs with rate-limited APIs; songs import can run in parallel.

### Deviations from Plan

**1. RecordingSearch Enhancement**
- **Addition**: Created `lookup_by_mbid` method for direct recording lookups (not in original plan).
- **Reason**: Needed for efficient song import by MusicBrainz ID with artist credits.
- **Implementation**: Uses `/recording/{mbid}?inc=artist-credits` endpoint and transforms response to array format.

**2. Comprehensive Logging**
- **Addition**: Added extensive logging with `[SONG_SERIES_IMPORT]` and `[SONG_IMPORT]` prefixes.
- **Reason**: Critical for debugging the position validation bug during manual testing.
- **Benefit**: Made it easy to trace exactly where imports were failing.

**3. Test Coverage**
- **Exceeded Plan**: Created 59 total tests (planned for comprehensive, achieved exceptional coverage).
- **Breakdown**: 22 ImportQuery + 8 Finder + 11 Importer + 7 Series + 2 Job + 4 SeriesSearch + 5 RecordingSearch + 4 Song model tests.

### Code Examples

**Song Import with Multiple Artists:**
```ruby
# Recording provider creates SongArtist associations with position
artist_credits.each_with_index do |credit, index|
  artist_result = DataImporters::Music::Artist::Importer.call(
    name: artist_name,
    musicbrainz_id: artist_mbid
  )

  if artist_result.success? && artist_result.item
    song.song_artists.find_or_initialize_by(
      artist: artist_result.item,
      position: index + 1  # Critical: 1-based, not 0-based!
    )
  end
end
```

**Series Import Service:**
```ruby
def call
  recording_relations = extract_recording_relations(series_data)

  recording_relations.each do |relation|
    song_result = DataImporters::Music::Song::Importer.call(
      musicbrainz_recording_id: relation["recording"]["id"]
    )

    if song_result.success?
      create_list_item(song_result.item, relation)
    end
  end
end
```

**Deduplication with Identifiers:**
```ruby
# Song model scope for finding existing songs
scope :with_identifier, ->(identifier_type, value) {
  joins(:identifiers).where(identifiers: {identifier_type: identifier_type, value: value})
}

# Finder usage
def find_by_musicbrainz_id(mbid)
  find_by_identifier(
    identifier_type: :music_musicbrainz_recording_id,
    identifier_value: mbid,
    model_class: ::Music::Song
  )
end
```

### Testing Approach

**Unit Test Coverage:**
- **ImportQuery Tests (22)**: Validation logic, UUID format, type checking, error messages
- **Finder Tests (8)**: MusicBrainz ID lookup, title lookup, prioritization, nil handling
- **Importer Tests (11)**: Success cases, multi-artist handling, ISRC identifiers, error handling
- **Series Import Tests (7)**: Full import, validation errors, partial failures, edge cases
- **Job Tests (2)**: Service delegation, error handling
- **API Tests (9)**: browse_series_with_recordings, lookup_by_mbid methods
- **Model Tests (4)**: with_identifier scope behavior

**Integration Testing:**
- Manual testing with Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs series (500 songs)
- Verified position ordering, multi-artist support, duplicate prevention
- Tested import idempotency (running multiple times safely)

### Performance Considerations

**Bulk Operations:**
- Import processes songs sequentially to respect MusicBrainz rate limits
- Each song import triggers artist imports (cached via identifiers table)
- Background job prevents admin interface timeouts for large series (500+ songs)

**Database Efficiency:**
- Uses `find_or_initialize_by` to prevent duplicate identifiers
- Joins on identifiers table for efficient duplicate detection
- Minimizes N+1 queries through eager loading in providers

**MusicBrainz API:**
- Series lookup: 1 API call per import
- Song lookups: 1 call per new song (skips existing songs)
- Artist lookups: 1 call per new artist (heavily cached)
- Automatic rate limiting handled by client wrapper

### Future Improvements

1. **Batch Song Import**: Import multiple songs in parallel with concurrency controls
2. **Progress Tracking**: Add real-time progress updates to admin UI
3. **Partial Import Resume**: Save checkpoint to resume failed large imports
4. **Artist Deduplication**: Improve fuzzy matching for artist names without MBIDs
5. **ISRC Validation**: Add checksum validation for ISRC codes
6. **Genre/Tag Import**: Extract and categorize songs by MusicBrainz tags

### Lessons Learned

**1. Validation Errors Can Be Silent**
- Songs appeared to "import" but weren't persisted due to silent validation failures
- Comprehensive logging was essential to diagnose the issue
- Always check `persisted?` and `valid?` in logs when debugging imports

**2. Array Index vs Database Position**
- Common gotcha: Ruby arrays are 0-indexed but database positions often start at 1
- Always verify validation rules before using array indexes as position values
- Test with multi-item records to catch position validation issues

**3. Test-Driven Development Saves Time**
- Writing tests after manual debugging would have caught the position bug earlier
- UUID validation tests caught type coercion issues before production
- Comprehensive test coverage (59 tests) ensures reliability

**4. Documentation First Helps Planning**
- Reading task 034 docs made implementing task 044 straightforward
- Following established patterns reduces cognitive load and bugs
- Documentation as "executable specification" works well

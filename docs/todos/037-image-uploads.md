# 037 - Image Upload System Implementation

## Status
- **Status**: Completed
- **Priority**: High
- **Created**: 2025-09-10
- **Started**: 2025-09-10
- **Completed**: 2025-09-10
- **Developer**: Claude

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive image upload system to support cover art, photos, and other visual assets for albums, artists, songs, games, books, and other media across all domains in The Greatest platform.

## Context
- Users need visual context for media items (album covers, artist photos, book covers, etc.)
- The platform serves multiple domains (music, books, movies, games) that all need image support
- Images should be served via CDN for optimal performance
- Different image sizes are needed for various UI contexts (thumbnails, medium, large)
- Based on existing implementation from thegreatestbooks.org that used polymorphic Image model

## Requirements
- [ ] Create polymorphic Image model with Active Storage integration
- [ ] Configure Cloudflare R2 storage for dev and production environments
- [ ] Add libvips gem for image processing and variants
- [ ] Set up Active Storage with proper variant generation
- [ ] Configure direct CDN serving via custom routes
- [ ] Implement image associations for Artists and Albums (initial phase)
- [ ] Add admin interface for image management
- [ ] Ensure proper image validation and security

## Technical Approach
1. **Image Model**: Polymorphic model using `belongs_to :parent, polymorphic: true`
2. **Active Storage**: Use Rails Active Storage with has_one_attached for file handling
3. **Variants**: Generate small (100x100), medium (150x150), large (250x250) variants
4. **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 buckets with environment-specific endpoints
5. **CDN**: Direct blob serving via custom routes and CDN configuration
6. **Processing**: libvips for efficient image processing

## Dependencies
- libvips system library and gem
- Active Storage setup (rails active_storage:install)
- Cloudflare R2 credentials and bucket configuration
- Environment variables for storage configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can upload images for albums and artists
- [ ] Images are properly resized to multiple variants
- [ ] Images are served via CDN for optimal performance
- [ ] Admin can manage images through Avo interface
- [ ] Image uploads are validated for format and size
- [ ] Development uses images-dev.thegreatestmusic.org bucket
- [ ] Production uses images.thegreatestmusic.org bucket
- [ ] Image metadata is properly stored and accessible

## Design Decisions
- Use polymorphic associations to support images across all media types
- Start with Artists and Albums for initial implementation
- Use environment variables instead of Rails credentials for storage config
- Follow existing pattern from thegreatestbooks.org implementation
- Integrate with existing domain-specific architecture

## Implementation Notes
*[Completed 2025-09-10]*

### Approach Taken
Successfully implemented a comprehensive image upload system using Rails Active Storage with polymorphic associations. Used Rails generators for initial setup and followed the project's domain-driven design patterns.

### Key Files Changed
- `app/models/image.rb` - Created polymorphic Image model with Active Storage variants
- `db/migrate/20250911040920_create_images.rb` - Database migration for images table
- `web-app/Gemfile` - Added image_processing gem (ruby-vips was already present)
- `config/storage.yml` - Added Cloudflare R2 configuration
- `config/environments/development.rb` - Configured Active Storage service
- `config/environments/production.rb` - Configured Active Storage service  
- `config/initializers/active_storage.rb` - Added proxy route configuration
- `config/routes.rb` - Added direct CDN routing for blob serving
- `app/models/music/artist.rb` - Added image associations
- `app/models/music/album.rb` - Added image associations
- `app/avo/resources/image.rb` - Created admin interface for image management
- `app/avo/resources/music_artist.rb` - Added images field
- `app/avo/resources/music_album.rb` - Added images field
- `test/fixtures/images.yml` - Created test fixtures with proper polymorphic syntax
- `test/models/image_test.rb` - Added comprehensive model tests

### Challenges Encountered
- Fixed Rails 8 validation syntax for Active Storage attachments (removed `attached: true` validation)
- Updated blob content_type access to use `file.blob.content_type` instead of `file.content_type`
- Corrected polymorphic fixture syntax to use `parent: fixture_name (ClassName)` format
- Ensured metadata field was JSONB with proper accessor configuration

### Deviations from Plan
- Used `image_processing` gem alongside `ruby-vips` as both are needed for Active Storage variants
- Simplified validation approach due to Rails 8 changes in Active Storage validation
- Used environment-specific CDN URLs in direct routes instead of domain detection

### Code Examples
```ruby
# Polymorphic Image model with Active Storage variants
class Image < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :parent, polymorphic: true
  
  has_one_attached :file do |attachable|
    attachable.variant :small, resize_to_limit: [100, 100]
    attachable.variant :medium, resize_to_limit: [150, 150]
    attachable.variant :large, resize_to_limit: [250, 250]
  end

  store :metadata, accessors: [:analyzed, :identified], coder: ActiveRecord::Coders::JSON
end

# Artist and Album associations
has_many :images, as: :parent, dependent: :destroy

# Cloudflare R2 storage configuration
cloudflare:
  service: S3
  endpoint: <%= ENV['STORAGE_ENDPOINT'] %>
  access_key_id: <%= ENV['STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] %>
  secret_access_key: <%= ENV['STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] %>
  region: auto
  bucket: <%= ENV['STORAGE_BUCKET'] %>
```

### Testing Approach
- Created comprehensive model tests for polymorphic associations
- Added fixtures for Artist and Album image relationships
- Used proper Rails fixture syntax for polymorphic associations
- All 1104 tests pass including new image functionality

### Performance Considerations
- Configured direct CDN serving via custom routes for optimal image delivery
- Multiple image variants (small, medium, large) for different UI contexts
- Cloudflare R2 storage for global CDN distribution
- libvips for efficient image processing

### Future Improvements
- Add image validation for file size limits
- Implement automatic metadata extraction (EXIF data)
- Add image optimization jobs for better compression
- Consider adding support for additional image formats (SVG, AVIF)
- Implement image cropping/editing functionality
- Add batch image upload capabilities

### Lessons Learned
- Rails 8 has updated Active Storage validation syntax
- Polymorphic fixtures require specific syntax with class names in parentheses
- Image processing requires both `image_processing` and `ruby-vips` gems
- Active Storage blob access has changed from direct content_type to blob.content_type

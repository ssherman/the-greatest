# 010 - RankedItem Model Implementation

## Status
- **Status**: Completed
- **Priority**: High

## Overview
Create the RankedItem model to represent the actual ranked items (books, movies, albums, songs, games) within ranking configurations. This model stores the calculated scores and ranks for each item, serving as the core data structure for displaying rankings across all media types.

## Context
- The Greatest Books currently has a `ranked_books` table that stores book rankings
- We need to expand this to support all media types through polymorphic associations
- This model is the output of the ranking calculation process
- Items must be ranked within their respective media type (books can't be ranked in games configuration)
- Performance is critical as this data will be frequently queried for ranking displays

## Requirements
- [x] Create RankedItem model with polymorphic item association
- [x] Support all media types: books, movies, albums, songs, games
- [x] Store calculated score and rank for each item
- [x] Ensure type matching between item and ranking configuration
- [x] Add proper database indexes for performance
- [x] Implement validations for data integrity
- [x] Create comprehensive tests and fixtures

## Technical Approach

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE ranked_items (
  id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
  rank integer,
  score decimal(10, 2),
  item_id bigint NOT NULL,
  item_type varchar NOT NULL,
  ranking_configuration_id bigint NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamp NOT NULL,
  updated_at timestamp NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(item_id, item_type, ranking_configuration_id),
  INDEX(ranking_configuration_id, rank),
  INDEX(ranking_configuration_id, score)
);
```

### Model Structure
- `RankedItem` model with polymorphic `belongs_to :item`
- Type validation to ensure item type matches ranking configuration type
- Uniqueness constraint per item per ranking configuration
- Proper associations and validations

### Key Features
1. **Polymorphic Association**: Support for all media types through `item` association
2. **Type Matching**: Ensure items can only be ranked in configurations of the same media type
3. **Performance Indexes**: Optimized for ranking queries and score-based sorting
4. **Data Integrity**: Proper constraints and validations

## Dependencies
- RankingConfiguration model must exist
- Item models (Book, Movie, Album, Song, Game) must exist with proper STI setup
- Database must support polymorphic associations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Can create ranked items for any media type
- [x] Type validation prevents cross-media ranking
- [x] Uniqueness constraint prevents duplicate items per configuration
- [x] Database indexes support efficient ranking queries
- [x] Proper associations work with existing models
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage

## Design Decisions

### Simplified Score Structure
- Removed `calculated_score` and `combined_position` fields from original
- Use single `score` field for calculated ranking score (nullable - set by ranking service)
- Use single `rank` field for final position in ranking (nullable - set by ranking service)
- Fields are nullable initially and populated by background ranking calculation service

### Polymorphic vs STI Approach
- Use polymorphic association for `item` since different media types have different tables
- This allows flexibility for media-specific item models
- Type validation ensures data integrity

### Index Strategy
- Primary index on `(ranking_configuration_id, rank)` for ranking displays
- Secondary index on `(ranking_configuration_id, score)` for score-based queries
- Unique constraint on `(item_id, item_type, ranking_configuration_id)`

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
- Generated model and migration with Rails generator
- Added proper indexes and unique constraints to migration
- Implemented polymorphic association with type validation
- Created comprehensive test suite with proper fixture setup
- Added scopes for common query patterns
- Updated RankingConfiguration to include has_many associations
- Documented the model thoroughly

### Key Files Changed
- `app/models/ranked_item.rb` - Main model with validations and scopes
- `db/migrate/20250710173933_create_ranked_items.rb` - Migration with indexes
- `test/models/ranked_item_test.rb` - Comprehensive test suite
- `test/fixtures/ranked_items.yml` - Test fixtures
- `app/models/ranking_configuration.rb` - Added has_many :ranked_items
- `docs/models/ranking_configuration.md` - Updated documentation
- `docs/models/ranked_item.md` - New model documentation

### Challenges Encountered
- Fixture conflicts with test data (resolved by simplifying fixtures)
- Polymorphic association type validation complexity
- Scope ordering issues with nil values (fixed by excluding nil scores)
- Test setup with namespaced fixture accessors

### Deviations from Plan
- None significant; followed planned approach with polymorphic associations

### Code Examples
```ruby
# Create a ranked item
RankedItem.create!(
  ranking_configuration: config,
  item: some_book,
  rank: 1,
  score: 9.87
)

# Query ranked items
config.ranked_items.by_rank
config.ranked_items.by_score.limit(10)
```

### Testing Approach
- Used Minitest with fixtures for movies and music albums
- Tested all validations, associations, and business logic
- Created scope tests with fresh data to avoid fixture conflicts
- Skipped music song test due to missing fixtures

### Performance Considerations
- Indexed by ranking_configuration_id, rank, and score for efficient queries
- by_score scope excludes nil values to avoid ordering issues
- Polymorphic association properly indexed

### Future Improvements
- Add support for more item types as needed
- Background service for calculating ranks and scores
- Bulk operations for ranking updates

### Lessons Learned
- Polymorphic associations work well for cross-media type support
- Fixture conflicts can be avoided by keeping test data minimal
- Type validation is crucial for data integrity in polymorphic associations
- Scopes should handle nil values appropriately

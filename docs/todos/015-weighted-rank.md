## Overview
Implement a versioned weight calculation system for ranked lists within ranking configurations. This system will calculate and populate the `weight` field on `RankedList` records based on penalties applied through the penalty system. The weight represents how much influence a list has in the overall ranking algorithm.

## Context
- The ranking system needs to assign weights to lists based on various quality and bias penalties
- The original Greatest Books site has 4 versions of weight calculation, showing this will evolve over time
- We need backward compatibility as algorithms improve
- The current `RankedList.weight` field is nullable and unpopulated
- The penalty system is fully implemented with static and dynamic penalties
- RankingConfiguration already has `algorithm_version` field for versioning

## Requirements
- [ ] Create base WeightCalculator service class in `web-app/app/lib/rankings`
- [ ] Implement WeightCalculatorV1 (starting with version 1) 
- [ ] Create bulk weight calculation service for all lists in a ranking configuration
- [ ] Support for dynamic penalties (calculated at runtime)
- [ ] Support for static penalties (fixed values)
- [ ] Handle list attributes that affect penalties (voters, quality, location, etc.)
- [ ] Version-aware calculation based on RankingConfiguration.algorithm_version
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all penalty scenarios

## Technical Approach

### Weight Calculation Strategy
Based on the existing penalty system, weight calculation will:

1. **Starting Weight**: Begin with a base weight (e.g., 100 or configurable value)
2. **Apply Penalties**: Reduce weight based on applied penalties:
   - Static penalties: Fixed percentage reductions from PenaltyApplication.value  
   - Dynamic penalties: Runtime calculated penalties (voter count, bias detection, etc.)
3. **Quality Adjustments**: Apply bonuses for high-quality sources
4. **Minimum Floor**: Ensure weight never goes below configured minimum

### Service Architecture
```ruby
# Base calculator with versioning support
module Rankings
  class WeightCalculator
    def self.for_version(version)
      case version
      when 1
        WeightCalculatorV1
      else
        raise ArgumentError, "Unsupported algorithm version: #{version}"
      end
    end
    
    def initialize(ranked_list)
      @ranked_list = ranked_list
    end
    
    def call
      # Calculate and update weight
    end
  end
end

# Version-specific implementation  
module Rankings
  class WeightCalculatorV1 < WeightCalculator
    def call
      # V1 specific logic
    end
  end
end

# Bulk processor for ranking configurations
module Rankings
  class BulkWeightCalculator
    def initialize(ranking_configuration)
      @ranking_configuration = ranking_configuration
    end
    
    def call
      # Process all ranked_lists for the configuration
    end
  end
end
```

### Algorithm Details (V1)

**Base Logic:**
1. Start with configurable base weight (100)
2. Calculate total penalty percentage from all applicable penalties
3. Apply quality source bonus (reduce penalties by 1/3 if high quality)
4. Subtract penalty percentage from base weight
5. Apply minimum weight floor

**Penalty Types:**
- **Number of Voters**: Dynamic penalty using power curve for lists with few voters
- **Geographic Bias**: Penalties for location-specific lists when inappropriate  
- **Category Bias**: Penalties for overly narrow category focus
- **Unknown Data**: Penalties for lists missing voter information
- **Custom Penalties**: User-defined static penalties applied via PenaltyApplication

## Dependencies
- Existing Penalty and PenaltyApplication models
- RankingConfiguration with algorithm_version field
- RankedList model with weight field
- List model with quality and metadata attributes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `Rankings::WeightCalculator.for_version(1)` returns V1 calculator
- [ ] Individual RankedList weight calculation works correctly
- [ ] Bulk calculation processes all lists in a ranking configuration
- [ ] Static penalties from PenaltyApplication are applied correctly
- [ ] Dynamic penalties calculate properly (voter count curve, bias detection)
- [ ] High quality source bonus reduces penalties appropriately
- [ ] Minimum weight floor is enforced
- [ ] Different algorithm versions can coexist
- [ ] All edge cases handled (nil values, zero voters, etc.)

## Design Decisions
- **Version Strategy**: Start with V1 instead of V4 to establish clean foundation
- **Service Pattern**: Use service objects following Rails conventions
- **Algorithm Versioning**: Use RankingConfiguration.algorithm_version to determine calculator
- **Penalty Integration**: Leverage existing penalty system rather than rebuild
- **Base Weight**: Use configurable starting value (default 100) 
- **Quality Bonus**: Apply before final calculation to reduce penalty impact

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
Implemented a versioned weight calculation system using service objects with the Strategy pattern. Created a base `WeightCalculator` class with version-specific subclasses (`WeightCalculatorV1`) for backward compatibility as the algorithm evolves.

### Key Files Changed
- `web-app/app/lib/rankings/weight_calculator.rb` - Base weight calculator with version factory method
- `web-app/app/lib/rankings/weight_calculator_v1.rb` - Version 1 implementation with penalty calculation logic
- `web-app/app/lib/rankings/bulk_weight_calculator.rb` - Bulk processing service for ranking configurations
- `web-app/app/models/penalty.rb` - Added `dynamic_type` enum, removed `dynamic` boolean, added `by_dynamic_type` scope
- `web-app/app/models/ranking_configuration.rb` - Added `median_voter_count` method for dynamic penalty calculations
- `web-app/test/lib/rankings/*_test.rb` - Comprehensive test suite (27 tests, 78 assertions)
- `web-app/test/models/ranked_list_test.rb` - Fixed tests to use fresh data instead of conflicting fixtures
- `web-app/test/fixtures/penalty_applications.yml` - Added penalty applications for music configuration testing
- `web-app/db/migrate/*_add_dynamic_type_to_penalties.rb` - Migration to add dynamic_type integer column
- `web-app/db/migrate/*_remove_dynamic_from_penalties.rb` - Migration to remove old dynamic boolean column
- `docs/services/rankings/*.md` - Complete documentation for all weight calculator services
- `docs/models/ranking_configuration.md` - Updated with median_voter_count method documentation
- `docs/models/penalty.md` - Updated with dynamic_type enum and revised scopes

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Circular Dependency**: Had to load WeightCalculatorV1 after base class to avoid inheritance issues
2. **Polymorphic Association Errors**: Dynamic penalties tried to join on polymorphic `:listable` which Rails doesn't support  
3. **Missing Models**: Books/Movies/Games models aren't fully implemented yet, so dynamic penalties had placeholder code
4. **Fixture Conflicts**: Tests failed due to uniqueness violations when using existing fixtures - fixed by creating fresh test data
5. **Test Mocking**: Initial attempts at complex Mocha stubs were overly complex for simple functionality tests
6. **Median Calculation Bug**: Initial median calculation didn't re-sort after condensing 1-voter lists, causing incorrect penalty calculations
7. **Books vs Music Models**: Books domain is incomplete, causing test failures - switched to using Music models which are fully implemented
8. **Penalty System Integration**: Required careful coordination between penalty applications (configuration-level) and list penalties (list-level)
9. **Power Curve Edge Cases**: Lists exactly at median voter count need special handling in penalty calculation algorithm

### Deviations from Plan
- **Dynamic Type Enum**: Added `dynamic_type` enum to Penalty model instead of using string-based ILIKE queries for better performance and type safety
- **Median Voter Count Calculation**: Implemented actual median calculation in RankingConfiguration instead of hardcoded values for context-aware penalty calculations
- **Removed calculate_preview Method**: Simplified BulkWeightCalculator by removing unused preview functionality
- **Simplified Dynamic Penalties**: Media-specific dynamic penalties return static values until full models are implemented  
- **Test Simplification**: Focused on core functionality tests rather than complex error simulation, used fresh test data instead of fixtures
- **Music for Testing**: Used Music models instead of Books models since Music is more complete and reliable for testing

### Code Examples
```ruby
# Calculate weight for a single ranked list (version-aware)
calculator = Rankings::WeightCalculator.for_ranked_list(ranked_list)
weight = calculator.call  # Uses ranking_configuration.algorithm_version to select V1
# => 75 (calculated weight, saved to ranked_list.weight)

# Or specify version directly
calculator = Rankings::WeightCalculator.for_version(1).new(ranked_list)
weight = calculator.call

# Bulk calculate weights for all lists in a ranking configuration
bulk_calculator = Rankings::BulkWeightCalculator.new(ranking_configuration)
results = bulk_calculator.call
# => { processed: 12, updated: 8, errors: [], weights_calculated: [...] }

# Bulk calculate for specific ranked lists only
results = bulk_calculator.call_for_ids([1, 2, 3])

# Check median voter count (used by penalty calculations)
median = ranking_configuration.median_voter_count
# => 25 (calculated from all lists in configuration)

# Access penalty types with new enum
penalty = Penalty.find(1)
penalty.dynamic_type           # => "number_of_voters"
penalty.dynamic?               # => true
Penalty.by_dynamic_type(:number_of_voters)  # => all voter count penalties
```

### Testing Approach
- **27 tests total** with 78 assertions covering all scenarios
- **3 test classes**: WeightCalculator (base), WeightCalculatorV1 (implementation), BulkWeightCalculator (bulk processing)  
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Base weight calculation, penalty application, quality bonuses, minimum floors, attribute-based penalties, voter count penalties with median calculation, bulk processing, error handling
- **Fresh test data**: Used factory-created data with unique names instead of fixtures to avoid conflicts
- **Mocha testing**: Used proper Mocha stubbing for complex scenarios
- **Music domain focus**: Tests use Music models since they're fully implemented and reliable

### Performance Considerations
- Replaced ILIKE string queries with enum-based lookups for better performance
- Used `find_in_batches` for bulk processing to handle large datasets efficiently
- Included proper database associations to avoid N+1 queries
- Transaction wrapping for bulk operations to ensure data consistency

### Future Improvements
- Implement media-specific dynamic penalty logic once Books::Book, Games::Game models are complete
- Add configurable base weights and penalty parameters to RankingConfiguration
- Consider caching calculated weights for expensive penalty calculations
- Add background job processing for very large ranking configurations

### Lessons Learned
- **Enum vs String Matching**: Using enums for dynamic penalty types is much more efficient and type-safe than string pattern matching
- **Service Object Benefits**: The versioned service object pattern provides excellent extensibility and testability
- **Test Simplicity**: Simple, focused tests are better than complex mocking scenarios for core business logic
- **Model Completeness**: Testing with fully-implemented models (Music) provides better confidence than incomplete ones (Books)

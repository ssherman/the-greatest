## Status
- **Status**: Completed
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Created**: 2025-07-31
- **Started**: 2025-07-31 
- **Completed**: 2025-08-02 
- **Developer**: AI Assistant

## Overview
Implement the first phase of a flexible data import system starting with Music::Artist imports from MusicBrainz. This establishes the foundation architecture for importing data across all media types (books, movies, games, music) using a strategy pattern with domain-agnostic base classes.

## Context
- Why is this needed?
  - Need automated way to populate artist data from external sources
  - Manual data entry is time-consuming and error-prone
  - Foundation for future import systems across all media types
  - Supports the goal of comprehensive content discovery platform

- What problem does it solve?
  - Reduces manual effort in populating artist information
  - Ensures consistent, high-quality data from authoritative sources
  - Provides extensible architecture for multiple data providers
  - Enables bulk imports and automated data enrichment

- How does it fit into the larger system?
  - Complements existing AI-powered artist details service
  - Integrates with existing IdentifierService for deduplication
  - Uses existing MusicBrainz API wrapper
  - Follows domain-driven design principles with Music:: namespace

## Requirements
- [ ] Create domain-agnostic base classes for reuse across media types
- [ ] Implement Music::Artist specific importer with MusicBrainz provider
- [ ] Use type-safe query objects for input validation
- [ ] Integrate AI-assisted matching for finding existing artists
- [ ] Support provider aggregation (multiple providers populate same item)
- [ ] Provide detailed import results with per-provider feedback
- [ ] Follow existing service object patterns and core values

## Technical Approach

### Base Architecture (Domain Agnostic)
```ruby
DataImporters::
  ImporterBase     # Main orchestration logic
  FinderBase       # Search and match existing records using AI assistance
  ProviderBase     # External data source integration
  ImportQuery      # Base query object
  ImportResult     # Aggregated results from all providers
  ProviderResult   # Individual provider success/failure
```

### Music::Artist Implementation
```ruby
DataImporters::Music::Artist::
  Importer < ImporterBase
  Finder < FinderBase
  ImportQuery < ImportQuery
  Providers::
    MusicBrainz < ProviderBase
```

### Import Flow
1. **Input**: Artist name via ImportQuery
2. **Find Existing**: Use AI-assisted Finder to check for existing artists
3. **Initialize**: Create new Music::Artist if none found
4. **Populate**: All providers contribute data to the same item
5. **Validate & Save**: Save if valid and any provider succeeded
6. **Return Results**: Detailed ImportResult with provider feedback

### Query Object Pattern
```ruby
query = DataImporters::Music::Artist::ImportQuery.new(name: "Pink Floyd")
result = DataImporters::Music::Artist::Importer.call(query)
```

## Dependencies
- Existing Music::Musicbrainz::Search::ArtistSearch service
- Existing IdentifierService for deduplication
- Existing Music::Artist model and validations
- AI services for intelligent matching (existing AI chat infrastructure)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can import artist by name: `DataImporters::Music::Artist::Importer.call(name: "Pink Floyd")`
- [ ] System finds existing artists using MusicBrainz identifiers
- [ ] AI assistance improves matching accuracy for ambiguous names
- [ ] Multiple MusicBrainz results are intelligently evaluated
- [ ] New artists are created with MusicBrainz data when no match found
- [ ] Detailed results show what each provider accomplished
- [ ] Base classes are reusable for books, movies, games domains
- [ ] All code follows naming conventions and service object patterns

## Design Decisions
- **Strategy Pattern**: Allows easy addition of new providers (Discogs, Wikipedia, etc.)
- **Query Objects**: Type-safe input validation specific to each domain
- **Provider Aggregation**: Multiple providers enrich same item rather than stopping at first success
- **AI-Assisted Matching**: Improves accuracy over simple string matching
- **Domain-Agnostic Bases**: Enables consistent patterns across all media types

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
Successfully implemented the complete data importer architecture with domain-agnostic base classes and Music::Artist specific implementation. The system follows the strategy pattern with provider aggregation, allowing multiple data sources to enrich the same artist record.

**Key architectural decisions:**
- Used inheritance-based design with abstract base classes for consistency
- Implemented query objects for type-safe input validation
- Created detailed result objects showing what each provider accomplished
- Followed existing service object patterns and Rails conventions
- Single-step MusicBrainz process: search results already contain rich data (country, life-span, ISNI)
- Enhanced finder to use MusicBrainz identifiers for better duplicate detection
- Comprehensive data population: country, life-span dates, multiple identifiers

### Key Files Created
- ✅ `app/lib/data_importers/importer_base.rb` - Main orchestration logic with provider aggregation
- ✅ `app/lib/data_importers/finder_base.rb` - Base class for finding existing records via identifiers
- ✅ `app/lib/data_importers/provider_base.rb` - Base class for external data providers
- ✅ `app/lib/data_importers/import_query.rb` - Factory for domain-specific query objects
- ✅ `app/lib/data_importers/import_result.rb` - Aggregated results with provider feedback
- ✅ `app/lib/data_importers/provider_result.rb` - Individual provider success/failure tracking
- ✅ `app/lib/data_importers/music/artist/import_query.rb` - Artist-specific query validation
- ✅ `app/lib/data_importers/music/artist/importer.rb` - Main artist import orchestrator
- ✅ `app/lib/data_importers/music/artist/finder.rb` - Artist finder with exact name matching
- ✅ `app/lib/data_importers/music/artist/providers/music_brainz.rb` - MusicBrainz data provider

### API Usage
The system is now ready to use with the clean API defined in the requirements:

```ruby
# Import an artist by name
result = DataImporters::Music::Artist::Importer.call(name: "Pink Floyd")

# Check results
if result.success?
  artist = result.item
  puts "Created artist: #{artist.name} (#{artist.kind})"
  puts "Country: #{artist.country}" if artist.country
  puts "Formed: #{artist.year_formed}" if artist.year_formed
  puts "Born: #{artist.born_on}" if artist.born_on
  puts "Data from: #{result.successful_providers.map(&:provider_name).join(', ')}"
  puts "Identifiers: #{artist.identifiers.count}"
else
  puts "Import failed: #{result.all_errors.join(', ')}"
end

# Detailed result inspection
puts result.summary
# => {
#   success: true,
#   item_saved: true,
#   providers_run: 1,
#   providers_succeeded: 1,
#   providers_failed: 0,
#   data_populated: [:name, :kind, :musicbrainz_id, :country, :life_span_data, :isni],
#   errors: []
# }
```

### Current Limitations
- **AI Matching**: Currently uses MusicBrainz ID and exact name matching; AI-assisted matching deferred
- **Single Provider**: Only MusicBrainz implemented; ready for additional providers

### Data Coverage Achieved
The enhanced provider now populates:
- **Basic Info**: name, kind (person/band)
- **Geographic**: country code (ISO-3166)
- **Temporal**: year_formed/year_disbanded for bands, born_on/year_died for persons
- **Identifiers**: MusicBrainz ID, ISNI(s)
- **Duplicate Detection**: Uses MusicBrainz IDs for reliable existing artist detection

## Testing Implementation
*[Added 2025-08-02]*

### Test Suite Architecture
Following the project's testing philosophy (Minitest with fixtures, 100% coverage), comprehensive unit tests were implemented focusing on:

- **Public interfaces only**: No testing of protected/private methods
- **Mocha mocking**: All MusicBrainz API calls properly stubbed
- **Concrete classes only**: Tests focus on actual Music::Artist implementation rather than abstract base classes
- **Realistic scenarios**: Coverage includes success, failure, and edge cases

### Test Files Created
- ✅ `test/lib/data_importers/music/artist/import_query_test.rb` - Query validation tests (11 tests)
- ✅ `test/lib/data_importers/music/artist/finder_test.rb` - Artist finding logic tests (6 tests)  
- ✅ `test/lib/data_importers/music/artist/importer_test.rb` - Main import functionality tests (5 tests)
- ✅ `test/lib/data_importers/music/artist/providers/music_brainz_test.rb` - MusicBrainz provider tests (7 tests)

### Test Coverage Summary
**29 tests, 82 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors**

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Successful Import Flow**: Artist creation with full MusicBrainz data (country, dates, identifiers)
2. **Existing Artist Detection**: Finding by MusicBrainz ID and name matching fallback
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when MusicBrainz API fails
4. **Artist Types**: Different handling for person vs band entities with appropriate date fields
5. **Data Validation**: Query object validation for required fields
6. **Provider Failures**: Proper error handling for network issues and missing data
7. **Partial Data**: Handling cases where MusicBrainz returns incomplete information

### Testing Approach Decisions
- **No base class tests**: Removed abstract base class tests to focus on concrete implementations
- **Mocked external dependencies**: All MusicBrainz API calls stubbed to avoid network dependencies
- **Fixture integration**: Leveraged existing Music::Artist fixtures for realistic test data
- **Public interface focus**: Tests validate public API contracts without testing implementation details

### Future Improvements
- **AI-assisted matching**: For ambiguous search results and name variations
- **Additional providers**: Discogs, Wikipedia, AllMusic
- **Enhanced data**: Description, aliases, relationships  
- **Batch import capabilities**: Import multiple artists at once
- **Import scheduling and automation**: Background jobs for large datasets
- **Conflict resolution**: Handle existing data conflicts intelligently
- **Import history and audit trail**: Track what was imported when and from where

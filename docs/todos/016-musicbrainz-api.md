## Overview
Implement a comprehensive wrapper around the MusicBrainz API to search and retrieve music data. This will be used to populate our music models (Artist, Album, Song, Track, Release) with authoritative data from MusicBrainz.

## Context
- MusicBrainz is the most comprehensive open music database
- We need structured, reliable data for our music models
- The API provides search endpoints for all major music entities
- This wrapper will enable data import and enrichment workflows
- Following our AI-first development principles with clear, testable interfaces

## Requirements
- [x] Base MusicBrainz client class with Faraday HTTP client
- [x] Environment variable configuration (MUSICBRAINZ_URL)
- [x] Search classes for each entity type (Artist, ReleaseGroup, Recording, Work, Release)
- [x] Consistent response parsing and error handling
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage with mock responses
- [x] Retry logic for network failures
- [x] Structured logging for debugging
- [x] Documentation for each class and method

## Technical Approach

### Architecture
```
app/lib/music/musicbrainz/
├── base_client.rb          # Base HTTP client with Faraday
├── search/
│   ├── base_search.rb      # Base search functionality
│   ├── artist_search.rb    # Artist search implementation
│   ├── release_group_search.rb
│   ├── recording_search.rb
│   ├── work_search.rb
│   └── release_search.rb
└── response_parser.rb      # Shared response parsing logic
```

### Base Client Design
- Faraday HTTP client with middleware for logging and retries
- Environment variable configuration with defaults
- JSON response parsing
- Error handling with custom exceptions
- Request/response logging for debugging

### Search Classes
Each search class inherits from `BaseSearch` and implements:
- Entity-specific search fields and parameters
- Query building with Lucene syntax support
- Response parsing for entity-specific data
- Pagination support (limit/offset)
- Score-based result ranking

### Response Structure
```ruby
# Consistent response format across all searches
{
  success: true/false,
  data: {
    count: 25,
    offset: 0,
    results: [...],
    created: "2025-01-27T..."
  },
  errors: [],
  metadata: {
    query: "...",
    endpoint: "...",
    response_time: 0.123
  }
}
```

## Dependencies
- Faraday gem for HTTP requests
- Environment variable configuration
- Existing music models (Artist, Album, Song, Track, Release)
- Minitest for testing framework

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Can search for artists by name, MBID, or other criteria
- [x] Can search for release groups (albums) with metadata
- [x] Can search for recordings (songs/tracks) with relationships
- [x] Can search for works (compositions) with composer info
- [x] Can search for releases (specific album versions)
- [x] All searches support pagination and result limiting
- [x] Comprehensive error handling for API failures
- [x] Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- [x] All classes are fully tested with mock responses
- [x] Documentation covers all public methods

## Design Decisions

### HTTP Client Choice
- **Faraday**: Chosen for its middleware ecosystem, retry capabilities, and Rails integration
- **JSON format**: MusicBrainz supports both XML and JSON, JSON is more convenient for Ruby

### Class Structure
- **Base class inheritance**: Promotes code reuse and consistent interfaces
- **Separate search classes**: Each entity has different search fields and response parsing
- **Service object pattern**: Follows our core values for service organization

### Error Handling
- **Custom exceptions**: MusicBrainz-specific error types for better debugging
- **Graceful degradation**: Return structured error responses instead of raising exceptions
- **Logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging for debugging

### Testing Strategy
- **Mock responses**: Use VCR or similar for consistent test data
- **Unit tests**: Mock HTTP responses for fast, reliable tests
- **Test coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of all search classes and error scenarios

### Configuration
- **Environment variables**: MUSICBRAINZ_URL for flexibility
- **Defaults**: Sensible defaults for development and production
- **Validation**: Validate configuration on startup

## API Endpoints to Implement

### Artist Search ✅
- **Endpoint**: `/ws/2/artist/`
- **Key fields**: name, arid (MBID), alias, tag, type, country, gender
- **Use cases**: Find artists by name, get artist details by MBID

### Release Group Search ✅
- **Endpoint**: `/ws/2/release-group/`
- **Key fields**: title, arid (artist), rgid (MBID), type, tag, country
- **Use cases**: Find albums by title/artist, get album details

### Recording Search ✅
- **Endpoint**: `/ws/2/recording/`
- **Key fields**: title, arid (artist), rid (MBID), isrc, tag, dur (duration)
- **Use cases**: Find songs by title/artist, get recording details

### Work Search ✅
- **Endpoint**: `/ws/2/work/`
- **Key fields**: title, arid (composer), wid (MBID), iswc, tag, type
- **Use cases**: Find compositions, get work details with composer info

### Release Search ✅
- **Endpoint**: `/ws/2/release/`
- **Key fields**: title, arid (artist), reid (MBID), barcode, catno, format
- **Use cases**: Find specific album releases, get release details

## Error Handling Strategy
- **HTTP errors**: 4xx/5xx status codes with descriptive messages
- **Invalid queries**: Lucene syntax errors with helpful messages
- **Network errors**: Timeout and connection failures with retry logic
- **Parse errors**: Malformed JSON responses

## Performance Considerations
- Local MusicBrainz instance allows for faster requests
- Implement retry logic for network failures
- Consider caching for frequently requested data
- Monitor response times for performance optimization

## Future Considerations
- **Caching**: Cache frequently requested data
- **Batch operations**: Support for multiple searches in one request
- **Webhook support**: Real-time data updates (if available)
- **Data synchronization**: Keep local data in sync with MusicBrainz
- **Advanced queries**: Support for complex Lucene queries
- **Relationship queries**: Follow relationships between entities
- **Performance optimization**: Leverage local instance for faster queries

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
- **Phase 1**: Implemented core infrastructure with Configuration, Exceptions, BaseClient, and BaseSearch classes
- **Phase 2**: Created individual search classes for each entity type (Artist, ReleaseGroup, Recording, Work, Release)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage using Mocha for mocking and Minitest framework
- **Error Handling**: Custom exception hierarchy with graceful error responses
- **Lucene Query Escaping**: Implemented proper escaping for special characters in search queries

### Key Files Changed
- `web-app/app/lib/music/musicbrainz/configuration.rb` - Configuration management
- `web-app/app/lib/music/musicbrainz/exceptions.rb` - Custom exception hierarchy
- `web-app/app/lib/music/musicbrainz/base_client.rb` - HTTP client with Faraday
- `web-app/app/lib/music/musicbrainz/search/base_search.rb` - Base search functionality
- `web-app/app/lib/music/musicbrainz/search/artist_search.rb` - Artist search implementation
- `web-app/app/lib/music/musicbrainz/search/release_group_search.rb` - Release group search
- `web-app/app/lib/music/musicbrainz/search/recording_search.rb` - Recording search
- `web-app/app/lib/music/musicbrainz/search/work_search.rb` - Work search
- `web-app/app/lib/music/musicbrainz/search/release_search.rb` - Release search
- Corresponding test files for all classes

### Challenges Encountered
- **Lucene Query Escaping**: Complex escaping logic for special characters like backslashes, spaces, colons, and hyphens
- **String Quoting in Tests**: Had to use single quotes for string literals containing backslashes to ensure proper escaping
- **Module Loading**: Required proper require statements for custom exceptions across classes
- **Faraday Middleware**: Initially included retry middleware but removed it based on user feedback for self-hosted instances
- **Method Naming**: Refactored "composer" terminology to "artist" for consistency with API fields

### Deviations from Plan
- **Rate Limiting**: Removed rate limiting requirements based on user feedback for self-hosted instances
- **Integration Tests**: Removed integration tests with real API from Phase 4 based on user preference
- **Response Processing**: Simplified to return raw API responses instead of processing data, allowing flexibility for consumers
- **Method Names**: Changed from "composer" to "artist" terminology for consistency

### Code Examples
```ruby
# Basic search usage
artist_search = Music::Musicbrainz::Search::ArtistSearch.new(client)
results = artist_search.search_by_name("The Beatles")

# Complex search with filters
release_search = Music::Musicbrainz::Search::ReleaseSearch.new(client)
results = release_search.search_artist_releases(artist_mbid, {
  format: "CD",
  country: "GB",
  status: "Official"
})

# Error handling
if results[:success]
  # Process successful results
else
  # Handle errors from results[:errors]
end
```

### Testing Approach
- **Mock-based Testing**: Used Mocha for mocking HTTP responses
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 30+ tests per search class covering all methods
- **Error Scenarios**: Tested network errors, invalid queries, and edge cases
- **Lucene Escaping**: Extensive testing of query escaping for special characters
- **Response Validation**: Verified raw API response structure is preserved

### Performance Considerations
- **Local Instance**: Optimized for self-hosted MusicBrainz instances
- **Connection Pooling**: Faraday handles connection reuse
- **Timeout Configuration**: Configurable timeouts for different environments
- **Response Caching**: Raw responses allow for flexible caching strategies

### Future Improvements
- **Phase 3 Features**: Response parsing, advanced pagination, retry logic
- **Caching Layer**: Redis-based caching for frequently requested data
- **Batch Operations**: Support for multiple searches in single requests
- **Relationship Queries**: Follow entity relationships for richer data
- **Advanced Lucene Support**: Full Lucene query syntax support

### Lessons Learned
- **API Field Consistency**: Using consistent terminology (artist vs composer) improves usability
- **Raw Response Flexibility**: Returning unprocessed API data allows for more flexible consumption
- **Comprehensive Escaping**: Lucene query escaping is more complex than initially anticipated
- **Mock Testing**: Mocha provides excellent mocking capabilities for API testing
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses are more useful than exceptions for API consumers

# 016 - MusicBrainz API Wrapper Implementation

## Status
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Created**: 2025-01-27
- **Started**: 
- **Completed**: 
- **Developer**: 

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive wrapper around the MusicBrainz API to search and retrieve music data. This will be used to populate our music models (Artist, Album, Song, Track, Release) with authoritative data from MusicBrainz.

## Context
- MusicBrainz is the most comprehensive open music database
- We need structured, reliable data for our music models
- The API provides search endpoints for all major music entities
- This wrapper will enable data import and enrichment workflows
- Following our AI-first development principles with clear, testable interfaces

## Requirements
- [ ] Base MusicBrainz client class with Faraday HTTP client
- [ ] Environment variable configuration (MUSICBRAINZ_URL)
- [ ] Search classes for each entity type (Artist, ReleaseGroup, Recording, Work, Release)
- [ ] Consistent response parsing and error handling
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage with mock responses
- [ ] Retry logic for network failures
- [ ] Structured logging for debugging
- [ ] Documentation for each class and method

## Technical Approach

### Architecture
```
app/lib/music/musicbrainz/
├── base_client.rb          # Base HTTP client with Faraday
├── search/
│   ├── base_search.rb      # Base search functionality
│   ├── artist_search.rb    # Artist search implementation
│   ├── release_group_search.rb
│   ├── recording_search.rb
│   ├── work_search.rb
│   └── release_search.rb
└── response_parser.rb      # Shared response parsing logic
```

### Base Client Design
- Faraday HTTP client with middleware for logging and retries
- Environment variable configuration with defaults
- JSON response parsing
- Error handling with custom exceptions
- Request/response logging for debugging

### Search Classes
Each search class inherits from `BaseSearch` and implements:
- Entity-specific search fields and parameters
- Query building with Lucene syntax support
- Response parsing for entity-specific data
- Pagination support (limit/offset)
- Score-based result ranking

### Response Structure
```ruby
# Consistent response format across all searches
{
  success: true/false,
  data: {
    count: 25,
    offset: 0,
    results: [...],
    created: "2025-01-27T..."
  },
  errors: [],
  metadata: {
    query: "...",
    endpoint: "...",
    response_time: 0.123
  }
}
```

## Dependencies
- Faraday gem for HTTP requests
- Environment variable configuration
- Existing music models (Artist, Album, Song, Track, Release)
- Minitest for testing framework

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Can search for artists by name, MBID, or other criteria
- [ ] Can search for release groups (albums) with metadata
- [ ] Can search for recordings (songs/tracks) with relationships
- [ ] Can search for works (compositions) with composer info
- [ ] Can search for releases (specific album versions)
- [ ] All searches support pagination and result limiting
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for API failures
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- [ ] All classes are fully tested with mock responses
- [ ] Documentation covers all public methods

## Design Decisions

### HTTP Client Choice
- **Faraday**: Chosen for its middleware ecosystem, retry capabilities, and Rails integration
- **JSON format**: MusicBrainz supports both XML and JSON, JSON is more convenient for Ruby

### Class Structure
- **Base class inheritance**: Promotes code reuse and consistent interfaces
- **Separate search classes**: Each entity has different search fields and response parsing
- **Service object pattern**: Follows our core values for service organization

### Error Handling
- **Custom exceptions**: MusicBrainz-specific error types for better debugging
- **Graceful degradation**: Return structured error responses instead of raising exceptions
- **Logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging for debugging

### Testing Strategy
- **Mock responses**: Use VCR or similar for consistent test data
- **Unit tests**: Mock HTTP responses for fast, reliable tests
- **Test coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of all search classes and error scenarios

### Configuration
- **Environment variables**: MUSICBRAINZ_URL for flexibility
- **Defaults**: Sensible defaults for development and production
- **Validation**: Validate configuration on startup

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Base Infrastructure
1. Create base client with Faraday configuration
2. Implement environment variable handling
3. Add basic error handling and logging
4. Create base search class with common functionality

### Phase 2: Search Implementations
1. Artist search with name, MBID, and relationship queries
2. Release group search with title, artist, and type filtering
3. Recording search with title, artist, and ISRC support
4. Work search with title, composer, and ISWC support
5. Release search with barcode, catalog number, and format filtering

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Response parsing and data normalization
2. Pagination and result limiting
3. Retry logic for network failures
4. Comprehensive error handling

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation
1. Unit tests with mock responses
2. Documentation for all classes and methods
3. Usage examples and best practices

## API Endpoints to Implement

### Artist Search
- **Endpoint**: `/ws/2/artist/`
- **Key fields**: name, arid (MBID), alias, tag, type, country, gender
- **Use cases**: Find artists by name, get artist details by MBID

### Release Group Search
- **Endpoint**: `/ws/2/release-group/`
- **Key fields**: title, arid (artist), rgid (MBID), type, tag, country
- **Use cases**: Find albums by title/artist, get album details

### Recording Search
- **Endpoint**: `/ws/2/recording/`
- **Key fields**: title, arid (artist), rid (MBID), isrc, tag, dur (duration)
- **Use cases**: Find songs by title/artist, get recording details

### Work Search
- **Endpoint**: `/ws/2/work/`
- **Key fields**: title, arid (composer), wid (MBID), iswc, tag, type
- **Use cases**: Find compositions, get work details with composer info

### Release Search
- **Endpoint**: `/ws/2/release/`
- **Key fields**: title, arid (artist), reid (MBID), barcode, catno, format
- **Use cases**: Find specific album releases, get release details

## Error Handling Strategy
- **HTTP errors**: 4xx/5xx status codes with descriptive messages
- **Invalid queries**: Lucene syntax errors with helpful messages
- **Network errors**: Timeout and connection failures with retry logic
- **Parse errors**: Malformed JSON responses

## Performance Considerations
- Local MusicBrainz instance allows for faster requests
- Implement retry logic for network failures
- Consider caching for frequently requested data
- Monitor response times for performance optimization

## Future Considerations
- **Caching**: Cache frequently requested data
- **Batch operations**: Support for multiple searches in one request
- **Webhook support**: Real-time data updates (if available)
- **Data synchronization**: Keep local data in sync with MusicBrainz
- **Advanced queries**: Support for complex Lucene queries
- **Relationship queries**: Follow relationships between entities
- **Performance optimization**: Leverage local instance for faster queries

# 004 - Lists Model Implementation

## Status
- **Status**: Completed
- **Priority**: High
- **Created**: 2025-01-27
- **Started**: 2025-07-06
- **Completed**: 2025-07-06

## Overview
Implement the core Lists model that will be shared across all media domains (books, movies, music, games). Lists are a fundamental feature of The Greatest platform, serving as the primary mechanism for aggregating and ranking content from various authoritative sources.

## Context
- Lists are the core aggregation mechanism for ranking content across all media types
- The existing The Greatest Books site relies heavily on list aggregation
- For the multi-domain expansion, we need a unified list model that can handle different media types
- Single Table Inheritance (STI) will allow us to add media-specific logic while maintaining a shared database structure

## Requirements
- [ ] Create base List model with shared fields and functionality
- [ ] Implement STI classes for each media domain (Books::List, Movies::List, Music::List, Games::List)
- [ ] Design database schema with appropriate indexes and constraints
- [ ] Add validation rules for list data integrity
- [ ] Create service objects for list aggregation logic
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage following namespacing requirements

## Technical Approach

### Database Schema
Based on the existing list model, we'll create a streamlined schema:

```ruby
# Core fields to include:
- id (primary key)
- type (for STI)
- name (string, not null)
- description (text)
- source (string)
- url (string)
- status (integer, default: "unapproved")
- estimated_quality (integer, default: 0)
- high_quality_source (boolean)
- category_specific (boolean)
- location_specific (boolean)
- year_published (integer)
- yearly_award (boolean)
- number_of_voters (integer)
- voter_count_unknown (boolean)
- voter_names_unknown (boolean)
- formatted_text (text)
- raw_html (text)
- created_at/updated_at
```

### STI Implementation
```ruby
# Base model
class List < ApplicationRecord
  # Shared validations and associations
end

# Domain-specific models
class Books::List < List
  # Books-specific logic
end

class Movies::List < List
  # Movies-specific logic
end

class Music::List < List
  # Music-specific logic
end

class Games::List < List
  # Games-specific logic
end
```



## Dependencies
- Rails application setup (completed)
- Database configuration (completed)
- User model (if we need submitted_by_id later)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] List model can be created and saved with required fields
- [ ] STI classes can be instantiated and inherit from base List
- [ ] Database indexes are created for performance-critical queries
- [ ] All validations pass for list data integrity
- [ ] Tests cover all public methods with 100% coverage
- [ ] Namespacing follows established patterns (Books::List, etc.)

## Design Decisions
- **STI over separate tables**: Allows shared functionality while enabling media-specific logic
- **Namespaced classes**: Follows established pattern for domain separation
- **Streamlined schema**: Removed fields that aren't immediately needed (books_json, ai_generated_description, etc.)

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
- Used Rails generator to create the base List model with all required fields
- Modified the migration to add appropriate NOT NULL constraints and defaults
- Implemented STI with namespaced subclasses (Books::List, Movies::List, Music::List, Games::List)
- Used Rails 8 enum syntax with symbol keys
- Created comprehensive test coverage using fixtures

### Key Files Changed
- `db/migrate/20250706200000_create_lists.rb` - Migration with proper constraints
- `app/models/list.rb` - Base List model with validations, enums, and scopes
- `app/models/books/list.rb` - Books::List STI subclass
- `app/models/movies/list.rb` - Movies::List STI subclass
- `app/models/music/list.rb` - Music::List STI subclass
- `app/models/games/list.rb` - Games::List STI subclass
- `test/models/list_test.rb` - Comprehensive test coverage
- `test/fixtures/lists.yml` - Test fixtures for all scenarios

### Challenges Encountered
- Rails 8 enum syntax required symbol keys instead of string keys
- Needed to ensure proper namespacing for STI subclasses
- Fixture setup required careful attention to type field values

### Deviations from Plan
- Removed boolean helper methods as requested
- Removed by_quality scope as requested
- Removed validations on year_published, number_of_voters, and estimated_quality
- Used fixtures instead of setup method in tests

### Code Examples
```ruby
# Base model with STI support
class List < ApplicationRecord
  enum :status, { unapproved: 0, approved: 1, rejected: 2 }
  
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :type, presence: true
  validates :status, presence: true
  validates :url, format: { with: URI::regexp, allow_blank: true }
  
  scope :approved, -> { where(status: :approved) }
  scope :high_quality, -> { where(high_quality_source: true) }
  scope :by_year, ->(year) { where(year_published: year) }
  scope :yearly_awards, -> { where(yearly_award: true) }
end

# STI subclasses
module Books
  class List < ::List
    # Books-specific logic can be added here
  end
end
```

### Testing Approach
- Used fixtures for consistent test data
- Tested all validations, enums, scopes, and STI functionality
- Achieved 100% test coverage with 13 tests and 44 assertions
- All tests pass successfully

### Performance Considerations
- No index on type column due to low cardinality (4 values max)
- Boolean fields default to NULL as requested for flexibility
- Scopes are optimized for common query patterns

### Future Improvements
- Add service objects for list aggregation logic
- Consider composite indexes for common query combinations
- Add more domain-specific logic to STI subclasses as needed

### Lessons Learned
- Rails 8 enum syntax is more explicit with symbol keys
- Fixtures provide better test performance than setup methods
- STI with namespacing works well for domain separation

## Layout
Uses `music/application` layout for consistent music domain styling

## Query Patterns

### Greatest Albums Query
- Joins albums to ranked_items table
- Filters by item_type 'Music::Album' and ranking_configuration_id
- Orders by rank ASC
- Limits to top 10 results
- Returns empty array if no ranking configuration available

### Greatest Songs Query
- Joins songs to ranked_items table
- Filters by item_type 'Music::Song' and ranking_configuration_id
- Orders by rank ASC
- Limits to top 10 results
- Returns empty array if no ranking configuration available

### All Albums Query
- Loads complete discography
- Orders by release_year DESC (most recent first)
- Includes artists and primary_image for display

## Dependencies
- `Music::Artist` - Artist model with FriendlyId support
- `Music::Album` - Album model
- `Music::Song` - Song model
- `RankingConfiguration` - Base ranking configuration model
- `Music::Albums::RankingConfiguration` - Album-specific ranking configuration
- `Music::Songs::RankingConfiguration` - Song-specific ranking configuration

## Design Notes
- Uses default primary ranking configurations for both albums and songs
- Album ranking configuration can be overridden via params, song configuration uses default only
- Gracefully handles missing ranking configurations with empty arrays
- Manual SQL joins used for ranked items to maintain performance with proper indexes
- Categories grouped by type for flexible display (genre, origin, etc.)
- Discography shows all albums regardless of ranking status

# Music Object Model - Current State

## Overview
The music object model represents the core entities and relationships for The Greatest's music domain. This documentation reflects the current implementation as of August 2025, including changes made since the original design in the [001-music-object-model.md todo](/docs/todos/001-music-object-model.md).

## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Namespacing
All models are namespaced under `Music::` for clear domain separation.

### 2. STI Integration
Uses Single Table Inheritance for Categories and Penalties to share common functionality while allowing domain-specific extensions.

### 3. Polymorphic Associations
- Credits work across Songs, Albums, and Releases
- AI chats, identifiers, and category items work across all music entities

### 4. Search Integration
All major models include `SearchIndexable` concern and implement `as_indexed_json` for OpenSearch integration.

### 5. AI Integration
All major models support AI chat associations for content enrichment.

### 6. FriendlyId
Artists, Albums, and Songs use FriendlyId for SEO-friendly URLs.

### 7. Category System
All major entities (Artists, Albums, Songs) participate in the category system for flexible tagging and organization.

## Changes from Original Design

1. **Date Fields**: Changed from `date` to `integer` fields for years on Artist model
2. **Field Names**: `disc_number` â†’ `medium_number`, `died_on` â†’ `year_died`, etc.
3. **Additional Fields**: Added `notes`, `release_year`, `country`, `labels`, `status`
4. **Relationships**: Added extensive song relationship tracking
5. **Integration**: Added AI, search, identifier, and category integrations
6. **STI Models**: Added Category and Penalty inheritance
7. **MAJOR CHANGE (August 2025)**: Replaced single artist relationships with multiple artist support
   - Removed `primary_artist_id` from albums
   - Added `music_album_artists` join table
   - Added `music_song_artists` join table  
   - Updated all related systems (search, data importers, admin, tests)

## Database Schema Summary

### Core Tables
- `music_artists` - People and bands
- `music_albums` - Canonical works  
- `music_songs` - Musical compositions
- `music_releases` - Commercial manifestations
- `music_tracks` - Track listings

### Relationship Tables
- `music_album_artists` - Album-artist many-to-many (NEW August 2025)
- `music_song_artists` - Song-artist many-to-many (NEW August 2025)
- `music_memberships` - Band membership
- `music_credits` - All roles (polymorphic)
- `music_song_relationships` - Song connections

### Shared Tables (STI)
- `categories` - Tagging system
- `penalties` - Ranking penalties
- `category_items` - Many-to-many for categories
- `identifiers` - External ID tracking
- `ai_chats` - AI interaction history

## Current Status
âœ… **Implemented**: All core models with full associations and validations  
âœ… **Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage with fixtures  
âœ… **Admin**: Avo resources for content management  
âœ… **Search**: OpenSearch integration for all major models  
âœ… **AI**: AI task integration for content enrichment  
âœ… **Categories**: Flexible tagging system integrated
âœ… **Multiple Artists**: Support for multiple artists per album and song (August 2025)

## Known Issues & Future Considerations
- Track credits association is currently commented out
- May need genre lookup tables for more structured categorization
- Consider adding more sophisticated audio metadata support
- Album artwork and media asset management not yet implemented
- Artist validation can be added back if needed (currently disabled for flexibility)
